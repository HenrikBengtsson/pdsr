# Data I/O with vroom

[`vroom`](https://vroom.r-lib.org/index.html) is a high-performance delimited data 
reader and writer with extended functionality.

```{r}
library(vroom)
```

## Read CSV

Argument `delim` specifies, the delimiter. Its default `NULL` value, will cause the 
function to guess by looking at the data. If you know the delimiter, best to specify it.

```{r}
ir <- vroom("~/icloud/Data/iris2.csv", delim = ",")
ir
```

`vroom` return a [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), which is very similar to a
`data.frame.`

```{r}
class(ir)
```

## Select columns at read

```{r}
ir <- vroom("~/icloud/Data/iris2.csv", 
            col_select = c("Sepal_Length", "Species"))
ir
```
