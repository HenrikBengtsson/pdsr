It is highly \nmemory efficient and can automatically parallelize internal operations to \nachieve substantial speed improvements over data.frames. The **data.table** \npackage weighs in at just a few kilobytes, has zero dependencies, and maintains \ncompatibility with R going back many versions.\n<br><br>\nAdvantages of **data.table** include:\n\n- Fast and efficient reading, writing, and handling of big datasets\n    - fast read & write of delimited files with `fread()` and `fwrite()`\n    - in-place operations without creating unnecessary copies of data\n- Compact and flexible syntax for data manipulation great for handling small or big data\n\nIn health data science, it is common to handle very large datasets, especially \nwhen working with electronic health record \n([EHR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record){target=\"_blank\"}) \ndata. In such cases, we often have to read, clean, reshape, transform, and merge\nmultiple tables of different dimensions, often featuring many millions of rows\nand thousands of columns. The benefits of `data.table` become immediately \napparent in such scenarios.\n\n## Installation {#dtinstallation}\n\nTo install from CRAN:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"data.table\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n`data.table` includes a built-in command to update to the latest development version:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata.table::update.dev.pkg()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Note on OpenMP support\n\n`data.table` automatically parallelizes operations behind the scenes when \npossible. It uses the [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) library to support\nparallelization. The current version of macOS comes with disabled support for\nOpenMP. \n\nCurrently, if you install `data.table` and OpenMP support is not detected,\na message is printed to the console when you load the library with\n`library(data.table)` informing you that it is running on a single thread.\n<br><br>\nThe \n[data.table installation wiki](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Installation#openmp-enabled-compiler-for-mac) described how to enable OpenMP\nsupport in the macOS compiler. The recommended option is to download the\nlibraries from the [mac.r-project site](https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/) and\ncopy them to the `usr/local/lib` and `usr/local/include` directories as \nappropriate.\n<br><br>\nAfter adding OpenMP support, you can compile the latest version of `data.table`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nremotes::install_github(\"Rdatatable/data.table\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf all works correctly, when you now load the library, it will inform you\nhow many threads are being used.\n\n## Resources {#dtresources}\n\n- [data.table GitHub](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table)\n- [data.table Documentation](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/)\n- [data.table Cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/datatable.pdf)\n",
