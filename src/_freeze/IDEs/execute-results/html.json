An IDE can make working in R easier, \nmore productive, and, importantly, more fun.\n\n## RStudio by Posit\n\n[Posit](https://posit.co/){target=\"_blank\"} (formerly RStudio), develops \nRStudio Desktop, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for R, which can be\ndownloaded from [here](https://posit.co/downloads/){target=\"_blank\"}. This is \nthe recommended environment for beginners. Make sure to keep your installation \nup-to-date.  \n\nIt is recommended to set up a new RStudio project for each data project.\n\nRStudio projects allows you to organize your work. Each project keeps track of \nyour [working directory, workspace, history, and source documents](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects).\n\nTo create a new RStudio Project click on File > New Project... from the main \nmenu or the \"Create a project\" icon (second from top-left usually) in the \nRStudio toolbar.\n\n## VS Code {#vscode}\n\nVisual Studio Code, a.k.a. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target=\"_blank\"},\nis a [source code editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code_editor){target=\"_blank\"} \nand one of the \n[most popular IDEs](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-new-collab-tools){target=\"_blank\"}\nacross different languages. The \n[VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace){target=\"_blank\"} \nincludes a very large number of extensions.\n\nThe ['vscode-R' extension](https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R) allows\nusing VS Code as an R IDE. To use it, you need to install the \n[`languageserver`](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver) \nand [`rlang`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rlang/index.html) \npackages:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='IDEs_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_13f2a5754e786407b701fc6bbdb1c011'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\"languageserver\", \"rlang\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe [`httpgd`](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd){target=\"_blank\"} graphics \ndevice is recommended.\n\nInstall it using:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='IDEs_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_b735707358f8f582057d0c56139ed6d7'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"httpgd\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nand enable it in the extension settings (\"Plot: Use httpgd\").\n\n\nThe ['Remote - SSH' extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh-edit){target=\"_blank\"} \nallows using a local VS Code installation (e.g. on your laptop) and executing \ncode (R, Python, etc.) on a remote server on which you have \n[SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell){target=\"_blank\"} access.\n<br>\n\nVS Code's ['Jupyter' extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) \nallows you to open and run [jupyter notebooks](#jupyter).\n<br>\n\nRead more about R support in VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n## Jupyter / Jupyter Lab {#jupyter}\n\n[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/){target=\"_blank\"} is a popular \n[notebook interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface){target=\"_blank\"},\nwhich supports multiple programming languages, including R.\n\n[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/){target=\"_blank\"} is \nthe \"next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter\".\n\nThere are different ways to install jupyter and jupyter-lab.\n\nOne way is:\n\n1. Install [mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n2. Use mamba to install jupyterlab:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='IDEs_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_e0958f94050ecf39d9f579a850a86fa6'}\n\n```{.sh .cell-code}\nmamba install jupyterlab\n```\n:::\n\n\n3. Install the IRkernel R packages:\n\n::: {.cell hash='IDEs_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_a38cc0c17c6bedd7722bcbc5949976df'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"IRkernel\")\n# or install latest development version\nremotes::install_github(\"IRkernel/IRkernel\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n4. Install the R jupyter kernel:\n\n::: {.cell hash='IDEs_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_858897b6fbbddfc6863caad7665d2bba'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nIRkernel::installspec()\n```\n:::\n\n\n5. Start jupyter-lab:\n\n::: {.cell hash='IDEs_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-6_d6064f540a2604ea1be2a1a4f2553260'}\n\n```{.sh .cell-code}\njupyter-lab\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere, you will be able to select the R kernel from the list of available\nkernels - usually at the top-right.\n",
