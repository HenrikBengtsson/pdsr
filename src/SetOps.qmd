# Set Operations {sec-setops}

R includes set operations that can be used on vectors of any type. It does not include a
dedicated set class. The inputs to set operations should be of the same mode.

```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
y <- c("c", "d", "e", "f")
```

## Set Union

```{r}
union(x, y)
```

## Set Intersection

```{r}
intersect(x, y)
```

## Set difference

R's `setdiff()` returns the **asymmetric** set difference between two vectors.

`setdiff(x, y)` will return elements in `x` not present in `y`:

```{r}
setdiff(x, y)
```

```{r}
setdiff(y, x)
```

## Test set equality

```{r}
setequal(x, y)
```

```{r}
setequal(c(1, 3, 5), c(3, 5, 1))
```

## Test if a value is element of a set

```{r}
is.element("b", x)
```

is the same as:

```{r}
"b" %in% x
```
