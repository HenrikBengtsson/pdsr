Tabular data typically consists of rows and columns, where the rows correspond
to different cases (e.g. patients) and the columns correspond to different
variables a.k.a. covariates a.k.a. features. Such data can be stored in
multiple different file formats.

This includes **plain text** files, often in a 
[delimited format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values){target="_blank"}, and **binary** files.

Common delimited format files includes comma- and tab-separated values 
([CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values){target="_blank"}, 
[TSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values){target="_blank"}).

Binary file formats can be either open (e.g. R's RDS format) or 
proprietary (e.g. Microsoft's Excel).

R includes built-in support for reading and writing multiple file formats, 
including delimited format files and its own binary RDS and RData files.

Third party packages add support for working with virtually any file type.

## CSV

### Read local CSV

`read.table()` is the core function that reads data from formatted text files 
in R, where cases correspond to lines and variables to columns. Its many 
arguments allow to read different formats.
<br><br>
`read.csv()` is an alias for `read.table()` that defaults to commas as 
separators and dots for decimal points. (Run `read.csv` in the console to print 
its source read the documentation with `?read.table`).
<br><br>
Some important arguments for `read.table()` listed here with their default 
values for `read.csv()`:

* `sep = ","`: Character that separate entries. Default is a comma; use "\t" 
for tab-separated files (default setting in `read.delim()`)
* `dec = "."`: Character for the decimal point. Default is a dot; in some cases 
where a comma is used as the decimal point, the entry separator `sep` may be a 
semicolon (default setting in `read.csv2()`)
* `na.strings = "NA"`: Character vector of strings to be coded as "NA"
* `colClasses = NA`: Either a character vector defining each column's type 
(e.g. c("character", "numeric", "numeric") recycled as necessary *or* a named 
vector defining specific columns' types (e.g. c(ICD9 = "character", 
Sex = "factor", SBP = "numeric", DOB = "Date")). Unspecified columns 
automatically determined. Note: Set a column to "NULL" (with quotes) to exclude 
column.

```{r eval = FALSE}
men <-  read.csv("../Data/pone.0204161.s001.csv")
```

### Read CSV from the web

`read.csv()` can directly read an online file. In the second example below, we 
also define that missing data is coded with `?`  using the `na.strings` 
argument:

```{r eval = FALSE}
parkinsons <- read.csv("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/parkinsons.data")

sleep <- read.csv("https://www.openml.org/data/get_csv/53273/sleep.arff",
                  na.strings = "?")
```

The above files are read from two very popular online 
[data repositories](https://rtemis.lambdamd.org/resources.html#datasets). 
Confusingly, neither file ends in `.csv`, but they both work with `read.csv()`. 
You can always look at the plain text file to determine if it can work with 
`read.table()`/`read.csv()` and what settings to use.

### Read zipped data from the web 

#### using `gzcon()` and `csv.read()`

`read.table()` /`read.csv()` also accepts a "connection" as input.  
Here we define a connection to a zipped file by nesting `gzcon()` and `url()`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
con <- gzcon(url("https://github.com/EpistasisLab/pmlb/raw/master/datasets/breast_cancer_wisconsin/breast_cancer_wisconsin.tsv.gz"),
             text = TRUE)
```

We read the connection and specify the file is tab-separated, or call 
`read.delim()`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
bcw <- read.csv(con, header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

#same as
bcw <- read.delim(con, header = TRUE)
```

#### using **data.table**'s `fread()`

You can also use __data.table__'s `fread()`, which will directly handle zipped 
files:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(data.table)
bcw <- fread("https://github.com/EpistasisLab/penn-ml-benchmarks/raw/master/datasets/classification/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.tsv.gz")
```

If you want `fread()` to return a `data.frame` instead of a `data.table`, you
can set the `data.table` argument `FALSE`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
bcw <- fread("https://github.com/EpistasisLab/penn-ml-benchmarks/raw/master/datasets/classification/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.tsv.gz",
              data.table = FALSE)
```

### Write to CSV

Use the `write.csv()` function to write an R object (usually data frame or 
matrix) to a CSV file. Setting `row.names = FALSE` is usually a good idea. 
(Instead of storing data in rownames, it's usually best to create a new column.)

```{r}
#| eval: false
write.csv(iris, "../Data/iris.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Note that in this case we did not need to save row names (which are just 
integers 1 to  150 and would add a useless extra column in the output)

## Excel .XLSX files

Two popular packages to read Excel files are 
[openxlsx](https://cran.r-project.org/package=openxlsx) and 
[readxl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=readxl).

## Read .xslx 

### `openxlsx::read.xlsx()`

```{r}
#| eval: false
bcw <- openxlsx::read.xlsx("../Data/bcw.xlsx")
```

### `readxl::read_xlsx()`

```{r}
#| eval: false
bcw <- readxl::read_xlsx("../Data/bcw.xlsx")
```

## Write .xlsx 

### `openxlsx::write.xlsx()`

```{r}
#| eval: false
openxlsx::write.xlsx(bcw, "../Data/bcw.xlsx")
```

Note: The `readxl` package does not include a function to write .XLSX files

## RDS

### Write single R object to an RDS file

You can write any R object directly to file so that you can recover it at any 
time, share it, etc. Remember that since a list can contain any number of 
objects of any type, you can save essentially any collection of objects in an 
RDS file. For multiple objects, see also the `save.image()` command below.

```{r}
#| eval: false
saveRDS(bcw, "bcw.rds")
```

### Read single object from an RDS file

To load an object saved in an rds file, assign it to an object using 
`readRDS()`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
iris_fromFile <- readRDS("iris.rds")
all(iris == iris_fromFile)
```

## RData

### Write multiple R objects to an RData file

You can use the `save()` function to save multiple R objects to a single .RData
file:

```{r}
#| eval: false
mat1 <- sapply(seq_len(10), function(i) rnorm(500))
mat2 <- sapply(seq_len(10), function(i) rnorm(500))
save(mat1, mat2, file = "./mat.RData")
```

Note: we will learn how to use `sapply()` later under 
[Loop functions](#sec-loopfns)

To load the variables in the RData file you saved, use the `load()` command:

```{r}
#| eval: false
load("./Rmd/mat.RData")
```

Note that `load()` adds the objects to your workspace using their original 
names. You do not assign them to a new object, unlike with the `readRDS()` call 
above.

### Write your entire workspace to an RData file

You can save your entire workspace to a RData file using the `save.image()` 
function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
save.image("workspace_2022-08-10.RData")
```

Same as above, to re-load the workspace saved in the `.RData` file, use the 
`load()` command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
load("workspace_2022-08-10.RData")
```

## System commands

Get working directory with `getwd()`

```{r}
#| eval: false
getwd()
```

You can set a different working directory with `setwd()`  

List files in current directory:

```{r}
#| eval: false
dir()
```

You can send operating system commands using `system()`:

```{r}
system("uname -a")
```
