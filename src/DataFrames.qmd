# Data Frames {sec-dataframes}

The [`data.frame`](#dataframestruc) is, like we saw in @sec-datastructures, one 
of the core R data structures used in Statistics, Machine Learning, Data 
Science. Data frames store tabular data, where rows usually represent cases and 
columns usually represent variables. Columns can be of different classes/types, 
e.g. numeric (float), integer, character, factor.

When working with tabular data structures, core data science techniques to 
learn include:

- Reading in data (see @sec-dataio)
- Reshaping (@sec-dfreshape)
- Joins (@sec-dfjoin)

alternative to `data.frame`
