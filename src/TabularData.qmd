# Working with tabular data

Tabular data is data organized in rows and columns. In most cases,
rows represent cases or observations and columns represent variables.

Common R data structures for tabular data:

- R's built-in [`data.frame`](#sec-dataframes)
- [`data.table`](#sec-datatable) from the eponymous package providing very high performance and powerful syntax
- `tibble` from the 'tidyverse' offers
[very limited advantages over data.frames](https://r4ds.github.io/bookclub-tmwr/tibbles-vs.-data-frames.html)

## Operations on tabular data

Important operations on tabular data include:

- Create new table
    - Define data types/classes
- Add rows or columns
- Filter: subset rows
- Select: subset columns
- Aggregate, a.k.a. group-by operations, a.k.a. split-apply-combine: split the
data based on some grouping, apply a function on each group's data, and return
the results
- Reshape: wide-to-long and long-to-wide transformations
- Join: Merge two tables
