# Tidyverse

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of packages
offering an alternative to base R or data.table for data manipulation.

Tidyverse packages and functions within packages are under active 
development and have changed names and syntax multiple times since their
introduction.

This section includes only a brief look at some tidyverse functions.
