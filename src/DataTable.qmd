# Data Table

The [**data.table**](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) package provides 
a modern and highly optimized version of R's data.frame structure. It is highly 
memory efficient and can automatically parallelizes internal operations to 
achieve substantial speed improvements over data.frames. The **data.table** 
package weighs in at just a few kilobytes, has zero dependencies, and maintains 
compatibility with R versions going as far back as possible.
