# Data Table

The [**data.table**](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) package provides 
a modern and highly optimized version of R's data.frame structure. It is highly 
memory efficient and can automatically parallelize internal operations to 
achieve substantial speed improvements over data.frames. The **data.table** 
package weighs in at just a few kilobytes, has zero dependencies, and maintains 
compatibility with R going back many versions.

The twoAdvantages of **data.table** include:

- Super fast reading, writing, and handling of big datasets
    - fast read & write of delimited files with `fread()` and `fwrite()`
    - in-place operations without creating unnecessary copies of data
- Compact and flexible syntax for data manipulation great for handling small or big data
