There are multiple ways to install R.

## Install from binary distribution

[CRAN mirrors](https://cloud.r-project.org/mirrors.html) are servers located in different
places around the world containing R binaries and source code. Choose one near your
physical location (for faster downloads), or select the 
[cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/) mirror, which automatically 
redirects your to a nearby server.

The R project maintains precompiled binary distributions of R for Linux, MacOS, and
Windows. Visit your CRAN mirror of choice and follow the instructions for your
operating system.

## Compile from source

If you are familiar with compiling software from source, you can download the R source
code from any CRAN mirror instead. If you don't know what this means, you may want to
start with a precompiled binary (see above). If you want to learn more you can learn more
on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler)

## Using rig

A newer method to install R is using [rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig). This lets
you easily install R, and allows you to maintain installation of multiple versions of R,
and makes it easy to switch between them.

To install rig, get the latest release from your operating system from 
[rig releases](https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases).

## Using Homebrew

You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install and maintain packages on your Mac, 
Linux, or Linux subsystem for Windows. To install R using the `brew` command line tool,
run:

```sh
#| eval: false
brew install r
```

## Using conda/mamba

Another way to install R is using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or 
[mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Using conda:

```sh
#| eval: false
conda install r
```

Using mamba:

```sh
#| eval: false
mamba install r
```
