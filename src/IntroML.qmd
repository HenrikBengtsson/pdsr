# Introduction to Machine Learning

[Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) refers to
a large family of algorithms that "learn" from data in order to perform a
number of different tasks.
<br><br>
Common tasks include:
<br><br>

**Unsupervised Learning**

- **Clustering**: grouping of objects based on a measure of similarity
- **Decomposition / Dimensionality reduction**: projection of a dataset to a 
new or reduced set of axes

<br>

**Supervised Learning**

- **Classification**: Prediction of categorical labels
- **Regression**: Prediction of a continuous outcome
