# Reproducibility, Robustness, Replicability {#sec-reprobrep}

The three R's, reproducibility, robustness, and replicability, are essential concepts
in science / data science. A short definition of each can help understand and 
remember the differences between them:

- **Reproducibility**: ability to produce same results given the same dataset and same analysis
- **Robustness**: ability to produce the same/similar results given same dataset and different analysis
- **Replicability**: ability to produce the same/similar results given different dataset and different analysis
