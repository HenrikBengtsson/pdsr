# Graphics

Visualization is central to all data analysis, whether in (bio)statistics, 
epidemiology, machine learning, data science, etc.
<br><br>
It is hard to overstate the importance of good visualization.
<br><br>
Some of the goals of data visualization include:
- Data quality check: identify miscoding, outliers, etc.
- Check data transformations, preprocessing in general
- Exploratory data analysis
- Plot data used for hypothesis testing
- Visualization of clustering, decomposition results in unsupervised learning
- Performance plots in supervised learning
- Communication of study results
<br><br>
R has powerful graphical capabilities built in to the core language. It 
contains two largely separate graphics systems: 'base' graphics in the 
`graphics` package, inherited from the S language, and 'grid' graphics in the 
`grid` package: a "rewrite of the graphics layout capabilities". 

<br>

There is limited support for interaction between the two. In practice, for a 
given application, choose one or the other. Note that there are no high-level 
(user-friendly) functions for the grid graphics system built into the base R 
distribution, but a few very popular packages have been built on top of it, the
most commonly used one today being 
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}.

<br>

Both base and grid graphics systems can produce beautiful, layered, 
high-quality graphics. It is possible to build custom functions 
(See @sec-functions) using either system to produce most, if not all, types 
of plots.
