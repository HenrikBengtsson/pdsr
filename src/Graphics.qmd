# Graphics

Visualization is central to all data analysis, whether in(bio)statistics, 
epidemiology, machine learning, data science, etc. It is used to check data, 
explore data, and communicate results.
<br><br>
R has powerful graphical capabilities built in to the core language. It 
contains two largely separate graphics systems: 'base' graphics in the 
`graphics` package, inherited from the S language, and 'grid' graphics in the 
`grid` package: a "rewrite of the graphics layout capabilities". 

<br>

There is limited support for interaction between the two. In practice, for a 
given application, choose one or the other. Note that there are no high-level 
(user-friendly) functions for the grid graphics system built into the base R 
distribution, but a few very popular packages have been built on top of it, the
most commonly used one today being 
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}.

<br>

Both base and grid graphics systems can produce beautiful, layered, 
high-quality graphics. It is possible to build custom functions 
(See @sec-functions) using either system to produce most, if not all, types 
of plots.
