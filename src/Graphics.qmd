# Graphics

Visualization is central to statistics and data science. It is used to check 
data, explore data, and communicate results.

R has powerful graphical capabilities built in to the core language. It 
contains two largely separate graphics systems: 'base' graphics in the 
`graphics` package, inherited from the S language, and 'grid' graphics in the 
`grid` package: a "rewrite of the graphics layout capabilities". 

There is limited support for interaction between the two. In practice, for a given 
application, choose one or the other. There are no high level functions for the 
grid graphics system built into the base R distribution, but a few very popular 
packages have been built on top of it. Both graphics systems can produce 
beautiful, layered, high quality graphics. It is possible to build functions 
using either system to produce most, if not all, types of plots.
