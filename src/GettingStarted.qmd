## Function calls

Working in R, like any programming language, involves calling functions.
For this to work as expected, you need to pass ***the right type of object(s)*** to the
***appropriate function***.

## Errors & Warnings

Given your specific goal, when you execute an R expression, there are a few possible outcomes:

### No warning or error

1. The code executes & produces correct output without issuing a warning (best case scenario).
2. The code executes BUT produces incorrect output without issuing a warning: Fix code to produce correct output (worst case scenario).

### Warning

3. The code executes & produces correct output but issues a warning: Fix code to avoid warning.
4. The code executes & produces incorrect output & issues a warning: Fix code to produce correct output & avoid warning.

### Error

5. The code stops execution & produces an error: Fix code to avoid error.

Notice how close the best and worst case scenarios are.
