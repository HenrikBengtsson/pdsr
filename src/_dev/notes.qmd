```{block, type="rmdtip"}
In R, everything is an object.

Every "action" is a [function](#functions).

[Functions](#functions) are also objects, which means they can be passed as 
arguments to or returned from other functions.

We shall see the relevance of this, for example, in the 
[Loop Functions](#loopfns) chapter.

```{block, type="rmdcaution"}
Double-bracket indexing a list with a multi
```

Beware (confusing) recursive indexing.  
(This is probably rarely used).  
Unlike in the single brackets example above, where you can use a colon to 
specify a range of elements to index, colon notation within double brackets 
accesses elements ***recursively*** at the given position.  

For example, the following extracts the 3rd element of the 2nd element of the 
list:

```{r}
x[[2:3]]
```
