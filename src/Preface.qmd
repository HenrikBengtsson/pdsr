# Preface

Throughout this book you will see boxes with R code followed by its output, if any. The code (or input) is decorated with a light blue border on the left to separate it from its output, like in the following example:

```{r}
x <- rnorm(200)
x[1:20]
```

Notice that R adds numbers in brackets in the beginning of each row. This happens when R prints the contents of a vector. The number is the integer index of the first element in that row. Therefore, the first one is always `[1]` and the number of the subsequent rows depends on how many elements fit in each line. If the output is a single element, it will still have `[1]` in front of it.  

Also notice that if we enclose the assignment operation of a variable in parentheses, this prints the resulting value of the variable. Therefore, this:

```{r}
(y <- 4)
```

is equivalent to:

```{r}
y <- 4
y
```

Currently, this site uses [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) to display source code, 
which supports multiple character ligatures that make code prettier / easier to read.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Ligated versions of some common character combinations as they should appear in this site"}
knitr::include_graphics("ligations.png")
```

Note that if you mouse over the input code box, a clickable "Copy to clipboard" appears on the top right of the box allowing you to copy paste into an R session or file.

This book was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org), ported from
the previous version which used bookdown.
