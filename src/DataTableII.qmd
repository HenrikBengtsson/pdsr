# **data.table** Advanced usage examples

This is a growing list of more advanced usage examples of **data.table**

```{r}
library(data.table)
```

## Index within groups

For example, get index for min or max whithin each group, where index
refers to the entire data.table.

Look at the documentation for `.I`

```{r}
ir <- as.data.table(iris)
ir[, .I[which.max(Petal.Width)], by = Species]
```

Use that to get the case with max Petal.Width from each Species

```{r}
ir[, ir[, .I[which.max(Petal.Width)], by = Species][[2]]]
```
