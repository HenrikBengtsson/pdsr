    "text": "Throughout this book you will see boxes with R code followed by its output, if any. The code (or input) is decorated with a teal border on the left to separate it from its output, like in the following example:\n\nx <- rnorm(200)\nx[1:20]\n\n [1] -0.9209017089  0.3494153785 -0.2467669820 -0.2513382832  0.5516227411\n [6]  0.6614612882  0.0146340151 -0.4148375080 -0.5659277961  1.0545659831\n[11] -0.0446052366 -0.2862816070 -0.7506902519  0.7226049130 -0.0009469217\n[16]  1.2598374579  1.3209108547  1.3689356279 -0.9192168977  0.5726541976\n\n\nNotice that R adds numbers in brackets in the beginning of each row. This happens when R prints the contents of a vector. The number is the integer index of the first element in that row. Therefore, the first one is always [1] and the number of the subsequent rows depends on how many elements fit in each line. If the output is a single element, it will still have [1] in front of it.\nAlso notice that if we enclose the assignment operation of a variable in parentheses, this prints the resulting value of the variable. Therefore, this:\n\n(y <- 4)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nis equivalent to:\n\ny <- 4\ny\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nCurrently, this site uses Fira Code to display source code, which supports multiple character ligatures that make code prettier / easier to read. \n\n\n\n\nLigated versions of some common character combinations as they should appear in this site\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you mouse over the input code box, a clickable “Copy to clipboard” appears on the top right of the box allowing you to copy paste into an R session or file.  Lastly, you will see the following informational boxes at times:\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThis book was created using Quarto, ported from the previous version which used bookdown."

    "text": "The S Programming Language is a statistical programming language developed at Bell Labs “to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully” (Chambers 1998).\nR is a modern implementation of the S language and part of the GNU Project.\nR is an interpreted language, allowing interactive work with data. It is written in C, Fortran, and R itself.\nSome of R’s strengths:\n\n\nThe base language (i.e. what is included in R when you first install it) comes loaded with functionality for:\n\ndata cleaning and manipulation\nstatistical testing and modeling\npowerful graphics\n\n\nThe vast ecosystem of third party packages brings extensive functionality for statistics, epidemiology, machine learning, visualization, image processing and much more. This includes specialized packages for many biomedical applications. \n\nSee also: What is R? on the R Project website. \nThis book was compiled using R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23).\nMake sure you have the latest version by visiting the R project website. \nNew versions of R are released regularly and it is a good idea to keep your version of R and installed packages updated.\nYou can get the version of R currently in use by printing the version object:\n\nversion\n\n               _                           \nplatform       aarch64-apple-darwin20      \narch           aarch64                     \nos             darwin20                    \nsystem         aarch64, darwin20           \nstatus                                     \nmajor          4                           \nminor          2.1                         \nyear           2022                        \nmonth          06                          \nday            23                          \nsvn rev        82513                       \nlanguage       R                           \nversion.string R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)\nnickname       Funny-Looking Kid           \n\n\nIt’s also a good idea to keep a log of the version of R and installed packages when beginning a new project.

    "text": "The simplest and most fundamental object in R is the vector: a one-dimensional collection of elements of the same data type, e.g. numbers, characters, etc. (known as an “atomic” vector).  For example, a numeric vector may consist of elements 12, 14, 20, and a character vector may consist of elements \"x\", \"y\", \"z\".  Vectors can exist as stand-alone objects, or they can exist within other data structures, e.g. data.frames, lists, etc.  This chapter covers different atomic vectors, and the next covers data structures (Chapter 7).  R includes a number of builtin data types. These are defined by the R core team - users cannot define their own data types.  Users can, however, define their own classes (Chapter 24).  The main/most common data types in R are:\n\n\nNumeric, including integer and double\n\nCharacter\n\nLogical (i.e. TRUE or FALSE, a.k.a. Boolean)\n\nOther data types include environments and closures i.e. functions (Chapter 15)."

Here, just for fun, we use rasterImage() to show how you would visualize such an image:\n\nx <- array(sample(1:255, 432, TRUE), dim = c(12, 12, 3))\npar(\"pty\")\n\n[1] \"m\"\n\npar(pty = \"s\")\nplot(NULL, NULL,\n     xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(0, 100),\n     axes = F, ann = F, pty = \"s\")\nrasterImage(x/255, 0, 0, 100, 100)"

    "text": "An index is used to pick elements of a data structure (i.e. a vector, matrix, array, list, data frame, etc.). You can select (or exclude) one or multiple elements at a time.  There are three types of index vectors you can use in R to identify elements of an object:\nInteger indexing in R is 1-based, meaning the first item of a vector is in position 1. In contrast, many programming languages use 0-based indexing where the first element is in the 0th position, the second in the 1st, and the nth in the n-1 position.  To understand indexing, make sure you are very comfortable with the core R data structures: vectors, matrices, arrays, lists, and data.frames. What is indexing used for?\nIndexing can be used to get values from an object or to set values in an object.  The main indexing operator in R is the square bracket [].\nLists use double square brackets [[]]"

It allows you to specify a series of individual [i, j] indexes, i.e. is a way to select multiple individual non-contiguous elements\n\nidm <- matrix(c(2, 4, 7, 4, 3, 1), 3)\nidm\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    2    4\n[2,]    4    3\n[3,]    7    1\n\n\nAn n-by-2 matrix can be used to index as a length n vector of [row, colum] indexes. Therefore, the above matrix, will return elements [2, 4], [4, 3], [7, 1]:\n\nmat[idm]\n\n[1] 52 44 27\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Logical index\nSelect all rows with values greater than 15 on the second column:\nThe logical index for this operation is:\n\nmat[, 2] > 15\n\n Row_1  Row_2  Row_3  Row_4  Row_5  Row_6  Row_7  Row_8  Row_9 Row_10 \n  TRUE   TRUE   TRUE   TRUE   TRUE   TRUE   TRUE   TRUE   TRUE   TRUE \n\n\nIt can be used directly to index the matrix:\n\nmat[mat[, 2] > 15, ]\n\n       Feature_1 Feature_2 Feature_3 Feature_4\nRow_1         21        31        41        51\nRow_2         22        32        42        52\nRow_3         23        33        43        53\nRow_4         24        34        44        54\nRow_5         25        35        45        55\nRow_6         26        36        46        56\nRow_7         27        37        47        57\nRow_8         28        38        48        58\nRow_9         29        39        49        59\nRow_10        30        40        50        60\n\n\nIndexing a matrix or a data.frame can return either a smaller matrix/data.frame or a vector.\nIn general, objects in R are returned in their most simple form unless otherwise specified.

    "text": "8.4 Data frames\nWe’ve saw above that a data frame can be indexed in many ways similar to a matrix, i.e. by defining rows and columns. At the same time, we know that a data frame is a rectangular list. Like a list, its elements are vectors of any type (integer, double, character, factor, and more) but, unlike a list, they have to be of the same length. A data frame can also be indexed the same way as a list and similar to list indexing, notice that some methods return a smaller data frame, while others return vectors.\n\n\n\nYou can index a data frame using all the ways you can index a list and all the ways you can index a matrix.\n\n\n\nLet’s create a simple data frame:\n\nx <- data.frame(Feat_1 = 21:25,\n                Feat_2 = rnorm(5),\n                Feat_3 = paste0(\"rnd_\", sample(seq(100), 5)))\nx\n\n  Feat_1      Feat_2 Feat_3\n1     21  1.65122996 rnd_96\n2     22 -1.26667371 rnd_91\n3     23  1.56324886 rnd_24\n4     24 -0.05798242 rnd_37\n5     25  1.21644022 rnd_42\n\n\n\n8.4.1 Get single column as a vector\nJust like in a list, using double brackets [[ or the $ operator returns an element, i.e. a vector:\n\nx$Feat_2\n\n[1]  1.65122996 -1.26667371  1.56324886 -0.05798242  1.21644022\n\n\n\nx[[2]]\n\n[1]  1.65122996 -1.26667371  1.56324886 -0.05798242  1.21644022\n\n\n\nx[, 2]\n\n[1]  1.65122996 -1.26667371  1.56324886 -0.05798242  1.21644022\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Get “one or more” columns as a data.frame\nAccessing a column by name using square brackets, returns a single-column data.frame:\n\nx[\"Feat_2\"]\n\n       Feat_2\n1  1.65122996\n2 -1.26667371\n3  1.56324886\n4 -0.05798242\n5  1.21644022\n\n\nAccessing a column by [row, column] either by position or name, return a vector by default:\n\nx[, 2]\n\n[1]  1.65122996 -1.26667371  1.56324886 -0.05798242  1.21644022\n\n\n\nx[, \"Feat_2\"]\n\n[1]  1.65122996 -1.26667371  1.56324886 -0.05798242  1.21644022\n\n\nAs we saw earlier, we can specify drop = FALSE to return a data.frame:\n\nclass(x[, 2, drop = FALSE])\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\nclass(x[, \"Feat_2\", drop = FALSE])\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n\nAs in lists, all indexing and slicing operations, with the exception of the $ notation, work with a variable holding either a column name of or an integer location:\n\nidi <- 2\nidc <- \"Feat_2\"\nx[idi]\n\n       Feat_2\n1  1.65122996\n2 -1.26667371\n3  1.56324886\n4 -0.05798242\n5  1.21644022\n\nx[idc]\n\n       Feat_2\n1  1.65122996\n2 -1.26667371\n3  1.56324886\n4 -0.05798242\n5  1.21644022\n\nx[[idi]]\n\n[1]  1.65122996 -1.26667371  1.56324886 -0.05798242  1.21644022\n\nx[[idc]]\n\n[1]  1.65122996 -1.26667371  1.56324886 -0.05798242  1.21644022\n\nx[, idi]\n\n[1]  1.65122996 -1.26667371  1.56324886 -0.05798242  1.21644022\n\nx[, idc]\n\n[1]  1.65122996 -1.26667371  1.56324886 -0.05798242  1.21644022\n\nx[, idi, drop = F]\n\n       Feat_2\n1  1.65122996\n2 -1.26667371\n3  1.56324886\n4 -0.05798242\n5  1.21644022\n\nx[, idc, drop = F]\n\n       Feat_2\n1  1.65122996\n2 -1.26667371\n3  1.56324886\n4 -0.05798242\n5  1.21644022\n\n\nExtracting multiple columns returns a data frame:\n\nx[, 2:3]\n\n       Feat_2 Feat_3\n1  1.65122996 rnd_96\n2 -1.26667371 rnd_91\n3  1.56324886 rnd_24\n4 -0.05798242 rnd_37\n5  1.21644022 rnd_42\n\nclass(x[, 2:3])\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n\n\n8.4.3 Get rows\nUnlike indexing a row of a matrix, indexing a row of a data.frame returns a single-row data.frame, since it contains multiple columns of potentially different types:\n\nx[1, ]\n\n  Feat_1  Feat_2 Feat_3\n1     21 1.65123 rnd_96\n\nclass(x[1, ])\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n\nConvert into a list using c():\n\nc(x[1, ])\n\n$Feat_1\n[1] 21\n\n$Feat_2\n[1] 1.65123\n\n$Feat_3\n[1] \"rnd_96\"\n\nclass(c(x[1, ]))\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nConvert into a (named) vector using unlist():\n\nunlist(x[1, ])\n\n            Feat_1             Feat_2             Feat_3 \n              \"21\" \"1.65122995877413\"           \"rnd_96\" \n\nclass(unlist(x[1, ]))\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n8.4.4 Logical index\n\nx[x$Feat_1 > 22, ]\n\n  Feat_1      Feat_2 Feat_3\n3     23  1.56324886 rnd_24\n4     24 -0.05798242 rnd_37\n5     25  1.21644022 rnd_42"

This results in a vector of 1’s and 0’s, NOT an integer index.which() converts a logical index to an integer index.\n\n\n\nwhich() literally gives the position of all TRUE elements in a vector, thus converting a logical to an integer index:\n\ninteger_index <- which(logical_index)\ninteger_index\n\n[1] 4 5 6 7\n\n\ni.e. positions 4, 5, 6, 7 of the logical_index are TRUE\n\n\n\nA logical and an integer index are equivalent if they select the exact same elements\n\n\n\nLet’s check than when used to index x, they both return the same result:\n\nx[logical_index]\n\n[1] 24 25 26 27\n\nx[integer_index]\n\n[1] 24 25 26 27\n\nall(x[logical_index] == x[integer_index])\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n8.5.2 Integer to logical index\nOn the other hand, if we want to convert an integer index to a logical index, we can begin with a logical vector of the same length or dimension as the object we want to index with all FALSE values:\n\nlogical_index_too <- vector(length = length(x))\nlogical_index_too\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nAnd use the integer index to replace the corresponding elements to TRUE:\n\nlogical_index_too[integer_index] <- TRUE\nlogical_index_too\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nThis, of course, is the same as the logical index we started with.\n\nall(logical_index == logical_index_too)\n\n[1] TRUE"

    "text": "9.1 Factors (introductory)\n\n\n\nFactors in R are a special type of vector.\n\n\n\n\nEach element can take one value from a set known as the factor’s levels\n\n\n\n\nA factor’s levels are stored in a particular order, which affects how that factor is treated by some functions, e.g. in hypothesis testing, model fitting, visualization, etc.\n\n\n\n\nYou can specify whether or not the order of the levels defines a quantitative relationship such that level1 < level2, etc., in which case the factor is known as ordered\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can create a factor by passing a numeric or character vector to factor() or to as.factor().\nThe difference between the two is that as.factor() does not accept any arguments while factor() does.\nLet’s start with a character vector that includes three unique values - “a”, “b”, and “c”:\n\nx <- c(\"a\", \"c\", \"b\", \"b\", \"a\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\nx\n\n[1] \"a\" \"c\" \"b\" \"b\" \"a\" \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\n\nAssume that “a”, “b”, and “c” define three different groups and we want to convert this character vector to a factor.as.factor() and factor() without any arguments produce the same output:\n\n9.1.1 Create a factor\n\nxf <- factor(x)\nxf\n\n[1] a c b b a a b c\nLevels: a b c\n\nclass(xf)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\nxftoo <- as.factor(x)\nxftoo\n\n[1] a c b b a a b c\nLevels: a b c\n\nclass(xftoo)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n\nNotice how a factor is printed in the R console:\n\nThe elements are printed without double quotes around them, differentiating them from character vectors.\nThe factor levels are printed below the vector values.\n\ntable() is a very useful function for factors - it gives the counts for each level:\n\ntable(xf)\n\nxf\na b c \n3 3 2 \n\n\nLet’s look at a different example. We define a factor to identify cases and controls:\n\ng <- factor(c(\"case\", \"control\", \"control\", \"case\", \"control\"))\ng\n\n[1] case    control control case    control\nLevels: case control\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the levels are ordered alphabetically.\n\n\n\n\n9.1.2 Set the order of factor levels\nYou can define the order of the factor levels with the level argument of the factor() function.\nFor example, the first factor level is used as the baseline in some statistical operations, e.g. glm(), in which case the “control” level should be first.\nMany plotting functions order categorical axes’ labels using the level order.\n\ng <- factor(c(\"case\", \"control\", \"control\", \"case\", \"control\"),\n            levels = c(\"control\", \"case\"))\ng\n\n[1] case    control control case    control\nLevels: control case\n\n\nThe levels argument can include values not present in the input data vector. This may be used for example when some known categories are not present in your sample, but may be added in the future, or you want specifically to show they are absent in a table or a plot, etc.\n\ng <- factor(c(\"Type I\", \"Type III\", \"Type III\", \"Type I\"),\n            levels = c(\"Type I\", \"Type II\", \"Type III\"))\ng\n\n[1] Type I   Type III Type III Type I  \nLevels: Type I Type II Type III\n\n\nOn the other hand, if the levels argument is specified and does not include one or more of the values present in the input data vector, the corresponding elements become NA:\n\ng <- factor(c(\"case\", \"control\", \"undefined\", \"control\", \n              \"case\", \"control\", \"undefined\"),\n            levels = c(\"control\", \"case\"))\ng\n\n[1] case    control <NA>    control case    control <NA>   \nLevels: control case\n\n\n\n9.1.3 Define level labels\nYou can define level names or labels other than the values in the input vector using the labels argument:\nAssume you started with the following character vector:\n\nx <- c(\"female\", \"female\", \"male\", \"female\", \"male\")\n\nYou can attach different labels to each level rather than default to “female” and “male” by passing a character vector to the labels arguments:\n\nxf <- factor(x, labels = c(\"F\", \"M\"))\nxf\n\n[1] F F M F M\nLevels: F M\n\n\nThe order of names in the labels argument must match the order of levels. In the above example, the levels default to c(\"female\", \"male\") because they are sorted alphabeticaly if not specified. Otherwise, we can specify both the levels and labels arguments to define both order of levels and provide new labels:\n\nxf <- factor(x, \n             levels = c(\"male\", \"female\"),\n             labels = c(\"M\", \"F\"))\nxf\n\n[1] F F M F M\nLevels: M F\n\n\n\n9.1.4 Change level labels of existing factor\nWe can change the labels of a factor object\n\nusing the labels argument of the factor() command in the same way we create a factor from a character or other vector\nusing the levels() command\n\nStart with a factor of two groups and change labels using the factor() command:\n\nxf <- factor(c(\"GroupA\", \"GroupB\", \"GroupB\", \"GroupA\"))\nxf\n\n[1] GroupA GroupB GroupB GroupA\nLevels: GroupA GroupB\n\n\n\nxf <- factor(xf, labels = c(\"A\", \"B\"))\nxf\n\n[1] A B B A\nLevels: A B\n\n\nStart with the same factor and change labels using the levels() command.\nThis is similar to using colnames() on a data.frame and is much faster than using factor() as above:\n\nxf <- factor(c(\"GroupA\", \"GroupB\", \"GroupB\", \"GroupA\"))\nlevels(xf) <- c(\"A\", \"B\")\nxf\n\n[1] A B B A\nLevels: A B\n\n\n\n\n\nThe levels() command changes the names of the levels. It cannot be used to change the order of levels, which must be done using factor()"

    "text": "9.2 Factors (advanced)\n\n\n\nA factor is a vector A factor contains three crucial pieces of information:\n\n\n\n\nThe underlying integer vector\n\n\n\n\nThe mapping of integers to labels\n\n\n\n\nWhether the factor is ordered\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s unpack these.\nBegin with a simple factor:\n\nx <- factor(c(\"female\", \"female\", \"female\", \"male\", \"male\"))\nx\n\n[1] female female female male   male  \nLevels: female male\n\n\nInternally, the command sees there are two distinct labels, female and male, and defaults to assigning integer numbers alphabetically, in this case female has been mapped to ‘1’ and male to ‘2’.\nPrinting a factor prints the vector of labels followed by the levels, i.e. the unique labels.\n\n9.2.1 The underlying integer vector\n\nEach level is assigned an integer. (Internally, this is the “data” that forms the elements of a factor vector). You don’t see these integers unless you convert the factor to numeric (as.numeric()) or look at the (truncated) output of str()\n\nas.numeric(x)\n\n[1] 1 1 1 2 2\n\n\n\n9.2.2 The mapping of integers to labels\n\nThis defines which integer is mapped to which label, i.e. whether 1 is mapped to male or female. You can store the same information regardless which one you choose to call 1 and 2.\nTo get the mapping you can use levels(). It prints the labels in order:\n\nlevels(x)\n\n[1] \"female\" \"male\"  \n\n\nAgain, this means that female is mapped to 1 and male is mapped to 2.\n\nstr(x)\n\n Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 1 1 1 2 2\n\n\nThe above tells you that x is a factor,\nit has two levels labeled as “female” and “male”, in that order, i.e. female is level 1 and male is level 2.\nThe last part shows that the first five elements (in this case the whole vector) consists of three elements of level 1 (female) followed by 2 elements of level 2 (male)\n\n9.2.2.1 Setting new level labels\nYou can use the levels() command with an assignment to assign new labels to a factor (same syntax to how you use rownames() or colnames() to assign new row or column names to a matrix or data frame)\n\nxf <- factor(sample(c(\"patient_status_positive\", \"patient_status_negative\"), 10, T),\n             levels = c(\"patient_status_positive\", \"patient_status_negative\"))\nxf\n\n [1] patient_status_positive patient_status_negative patient_status_positive\n [4] patient_status_positive patient_status_negative patient_status_positive\n [7] patient_status_negative patient_status_negative patient_status_negative\n[10] patient_status_negative\nLevels: patient_status_positive patient_status_negative\n\n\n\nlevels(xf)\n\n[1] \"patient_status_positive\" \"patient_status_negative\"\n\nlevels(xf) <- c(\"positive\", \"negative\")\nxf\n\n [1] positive negative positive positive negative positive negative negative\n [9] negative negative\nLevels: positive negative\n\n\n\n9.2.2.2 Defining the mapping of labels to integers\nIf you want to define the mapping of labels to their integer representation (and not default to them sorted alphabeticaly), you use the levels arguments of the factor() function.\nThe vector passed to the levels arguments must include at least all unique values passed to factor(), otherwise you will get NA values\nWithout defining levels they are assigned alphabeticaly:\n\nx <- factor(c(\"alpha\", \"alpha\", \"gamma\", \"delta\", \"delta\"))\nx\n\n[1] alpha alpha gamma delta delta\nLevels: alpha delta gamma\n\n\nDefine levels:\n\nx <- factor(c(\"alpha\", \"alpha\", \"gamma\", \"delta\", \"delta\"),\n            levels = c(\"alpha\", \"gamma\", \"delta\"))\nx\n\n[1] alpha alpha gamma delta delta\nLevels: alpha gamma delta\n\n\nThe table command has a number of useful applications, in it simplest form, it tabulates number of elements with each unique value found in a vector:\n\ntable(x)\n\nx\nalpha gamma delta \n    2     1     2 \n\n\nIf you forget (or choose to exclude) a level, all occurences are replaced by NA:\n\nx <- factor(c(\"alpha\", \"alpha\", \"gamma\", \"delta\", \"delta\"),\n            levels = c(\"alpha\", \"gamma\"))\nx\n\n[1] alpha alpha gamma <NA>  <NA> \nLevels: alpha gamma\n\n\nIf you know that more levels exist, even if no examples are present in your sample, you can includes these extra levels:\n\nx <- factor(c(\"alpha\", \"alpha\", \"gamma\", \"delta\", \"delta\"),\n            levels = c(\"alpha\", \"beta\", \"gamma\", \"delta\"))\nx\n\n[1] alpha alpha gamma delta delta\nLevels: alpha beta gamma delta\n\n\n\ntable(x)\n\nx\nalpha  beta gamma delta \n    2     0     1     2 \n\n\n\n9.2.3 Is the factor ordered\n\nWe looked at how you can define the order of levels using the levels argument in factor(), which affects the integer mapping to each label.\nThis can affect how some applications treat the different levels.\nOn top of the order of the mapping, you can further define if there is a quantitative relationship among levels of the form level 1 < level 2 < ... < level n. This, in turn, can affect how the factor is treated by some functions, like some functions that fit statistical models.\n\n\n\nAll factors’ levels appear in some order or other.\n\n\nAn ordered factor indicates that its levels have a quantitative relationship of the form level 1 < level 2 < … < level n.\n\n\n\nFirst an unordered factor:\n\ndat <- sample(c(\"small\", \"medium\", \"large\"), 10, TRUE)\nx <- factor(dat)\nx\n\n [1] small  small  small  small  small  medium medium small  large  large \nLevels: large medium small\n\n\nTo make the above into an ordered factor, we need to define the order of the levels with the levels arguments and also specify that it is ordered with the ordered argument:\n\nx <- factor(dat,\n            levels = c(\"small\", \"medium\", \"large\"),\n            ordered = TRUE)\nx\n\n [1] small  small  small  small  small  medium medium small  large  large \nLevels: small < medium < large\n\n\nNote how the levels now include the < sign between levels to indicate the ordering.\n\n9.2.4 Change order of levels or labels\nWe’ve seen how to create a factor with defined order of levels and how to change level labels already. Because these are prone to serious accidents, let’s look at them again, together.\nTo change the order of levels of an existing factor use factor():\n\nx <- factor(c(\"target\", \"target\", \"control\", \"control\", \"control\"))\nx\n\n[1] target  target  control control control\nLevels: control target\n\n\nChange the order so that target is first (i.e. corresponds to 1:\n\nx <- factor(x, levels = c(\"target\", \"control\"))\nx\n\n[1] target  target  control control control\nLevels: target control\n\n\nTo change the labels of the levels use levels():\n\nx\n\n[1] target  target  control control control\nLevels: target control\n\nlevels(x) <- c(\"hit\", \"decoy\")\nx\n\n[1] hit   hit   decoy decoy decoy\nLevels: hit decoy\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the levels of a factor with levels() does not change the internal integer representation but changes every element’s label.\n\n\n\n\n9.2.5 Fatal error to avoid\nExample scenario: You receive a dataset for classification where the outcome is a factor of 1s and 0s:\n\noutcome <- factor(c(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0))\noutcome\n\n[1] 1 1 0 0 0 1 0\nLevels: 0 1\n\n\nSome classification procedures expect the first level to be the ‘positive’ outcome, so you decide to reorder the levels.\nYou mistakenly use levels() instead of factor(x, levels=c(...)) hoping to achieve this.\nYou end up flipping all the outcome values.\n\nlevels(outcome) <- c(\"1\", \"0\")\noutcome\n\n[1] 0 0 1 1 1 0 1\nLevels: 1 0\n\n\nAll zeros became ones and ones became zeros.\nYour model does the exact opposite of what you intended.\n\n9.2.6 Factor to numeric\nWhile it often makes sense to have factors with words for labels, they can be any character and that includes numbers (i.e. numbers which are treated as labels)\n\nf <- factor(c(3, 7, 7, 9, 3, 3, 9))\nf\n\n[1] 3 7 7 9 3 3 9\nLevels: 3 7 9\n\n\nThis behaves just like any other factor with all the rules we learned above.\nThere is a very easy trap to fall into, if you ever decide to convert such a factor to numeric.\nThe first thing that usually comes to mind is to use as.numeric().\n\n# !don't do this!\nas.numeric(f)\n\n[1] 1 2 2 3 1 1 3\n\n\nBut! We already know this will return the integer index, it will not return the labels as numbers.\nBy understanding the internal representation of the factor, i.e. that a factor is an integer vector indexing a set of labels, you can convert labels to numeric exactly by indexing the set of labels:\n\nlevels(f)[f]\n\n[1] \"3\" \"7\" \"7\" \"9\" \"3\" \"3\" \"9\"\n\n\nThe above suggests that used as an index within the brackets, f is coerced to integer, therefore to understand the above:\n\nlevels(f)\n\n[1] \"3\" \"7\" \"9\"\n\nlevels(f)[as.integer(f)]\n\n[1] \"3\" \"7\" \"7\" \"9\" \"3\" \"3\" \"9\"\n\n# same as\nlevels(f)[f]\n\n[1] \"3\" \"7\" \"7\" \"9\" \"3\" \"3\" \"9\"\n\n\nA different way around this that may be less confusing is to simply convert the factor to character and then to numeric:\n\nas.numeric(as.character(f))\n\n[1] 3 7 7 9 3 3 9"

    "text": "10.1 CSV\n\n10.1.1 Read local CSV\nread.table() is the core function that reads data from formatted text files in R, where cases correspond to lines and variables to columns. Its many arguments allow to read different formats. read.csv() is an alias for read.table() that defaults to commas as separators and dots for decimal points. (Run read.csv in the console to print its source read the documentation with ?read.table).  Some important arguments for read.table() listed here with their default values for read.csv():\n\n\nsep = \",\": Character that separate entries. Default is a comma; use “ for tab-separated files (default setting in read.delim())\n\ndec = \".\": Character for the decimal point. Default is a dot; in some cases where a comma is used as the decimal point, the entry separator sep may be a semicolon (default setting in read.csv2())\n\nna.strings = \"NA\": Character vector of strings to be coded as “NA”\n\ncolClasses = NA: Either a character vector defining each column’s type (e.g. c(“character”, “numeric”, “numeric”) recycled as necessary or a named vector defining specific columns’ types (e.g. c(ICD9 = “character”, Sex = “factor”, SBP = “numeric”, DOB = “Date”)). Unspecified columns are automatically determined. Note: Set a column to “NULL” (with quotes) to exclude that column.\n\nstringsAsFactors = TRUE: Will convert all character vectors to factors\n\n\nmen <-  read.csv(\"../Data/pone.0204161.s001.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nWhen working in Windows, paths should use either single forward slashes or double backslashes\n\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Read CSV from the web\nread.csv() can directly read an online file. In the second example below, we also define that missing data is coded with ? using the na.strings argument:\n\nhf <- read.csv(\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00519/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv\"\n\nThe above file is read directly from the UCI ML repository (See data repositories).\n\n10.1.3 Read zipped data from the web\n\n10.1.3.1 using gzcon() and csv.read()\n\nread.table() /read.csv() also accepts a “connection” as input.\nHere we define a connection to a zipped file by nesting gzcon() and url():\n\ncon <- gzcon(url(\"https://github.com/EpistasisLab/pmlb/raw/master/datasets/breast_cancer_wisconsin/breast_cancer_wisconsin.tsv.gz\"),\n             text = TRUE)\n\nWe read the connection and specify the file is tab-separated, or call read.delim():\n\nbcw <- read.csv(con, header = TRUE, sep = \"\\t\")\n\n#same as\nbcw <- read.delim(con, header = TRUE)\n\n\n10.1.4 Write to CSV\nUse the write.csv() function to write an R object (usually data frame or matrix) to a CSV file. Setting row.names = FALSE is usually a good idea. (Instead of storing data in rownames, it’s usually best to create a new column.)\n\nwrite.csv(iris, \"../Data/iris.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nNote that in this case we did not need to save row names (which are just integers 1 to 150 and would add a useless extra column in the output)"

While a lot of these operations are often performed using loop functions instead, for-loops can also be used.\nYou can start by initializing an object of the appropriate class and dimensions to hold the output. Then, each iteration of the for loop will assign its output to the corresponding element/s of this object.\nIn the following example we transform the mtcars built-in dataset’s features to z-scores. The built-in command scale() will do this for quickly and conveniently, this is for demonstration purposes:\nFirst, initialize the output to be the desired class and dimensions:\n\nclass(mtcars)\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\ndim(mtcars)\n\n[1] 32 11\n\nmtcars_z <- data.frame(matrix(0, 32, 11))\ncolnames(mtcars_z) <- colnames(mtcars)\n\nor, it is simpler to just make a copy of mtcars to be overwritten by the for loop later:\n\nmtcars_z <- mtcars\n\nStandardization involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.\nHere is the for loop - we iterate through each column and assign the transformed data:\n\nfor (i in 1:ncol(mtcars)) {\n  mtcars_z[, i] <- (mtcars[, i] - mean(mtcars[, i])) / sd(mtcars[, i])\n}\n\nLet’s compare to the output of the scale() command by print the first 3 rows and columns of each:\n\nmtcars_z2 <- as.data.frame(scale(mtcars))\nmtcars_z[1:3, 1:3]\n\n                    mpg        cyl       disp\nMazda RX4     0.1508848 -0.1049878 -0.5706198\nMazda RX4 Wag 0.1508848 -0.1049878 -0.5706198\nDatsun 710    0.4495434 -1.2248578 -0.9901821\n\nmtcars_z2[1:3, 1:3]\n\n                    mpg        cyl       disp\nMazda RX4     0.1508848 -0.1049878 -0.5706198\nMazda RX4 Wag 0.1508848 -0.1049878 -0.5706198\nDatsun 710    0.4495434 -1.2248578 -0.9901821\n\n\nNote that we wrapped scale() around as.data.frame() because it outputs a matrix.\n\nall.equal(mtcars_z, mtcars_z2)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n12.2.1.2 Nested for loops\n\na <- matrix(1:9, 3)\nfor (i in seq(3)) {\n  for (j in seq(3)) {\n    cat(\"  a[\", i, \",\", j, \"] is \", a[i, j], \"\\n\", sep = \"\")\n  }\n}\n\n  a[1,1] is 1\n  a[1,2] is 4\n  a[1,3] is 7\n  a[2,1] is 2\n  a[2,2] is 5\n  a[2,3] is 8\n  a[3,1] is 3\n  a[3,2] is 6\n  a[3,3] is 9\n\n\n\n12.2.1.3 Printing within a for loop\nIn the R console objects get printed just by typing their name:\n\na <- 4\na\n\n[1] 4\n\n# same as\nprint(a)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nThis “automatic printing” does not happen within a for loop, so you simply use print() (or cat() as preferred):\nThe following loop does not print out anything:\n\na <- 0\nfor (i in 1:4) {\n  a <- a + i^2\n  a\n}\n\nbut this does:\n\na <- 0\nfor (i in 1:4) {\n  a <- a + i^2\n  print(a)\n}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 5\n[1] 14\n[1] 30\n\n\n\n12.2.2 Conditional assignment with multiple options using switch()\n\nInstead of using multiple if - else if statements, we can build a more compact call using switch. (It is best suited for options that are of type character, rather than numeric)\n\ny <- sample(letters[seq(8)], 1)\ny\n\n[1] \"c\"\n\noutput <- switch(y,                      # 1.

Functions in R are “first-class objects”.\nThis means they can be stored inside other objects (e.g. a list), they can be passed as arguments to other functions and can be returned as output from functions.  For example, you can use a command like apply(mat, 2, mean)  Functions in R are for the most part like mathematical functions: they have one or more inputs and one output. The inputs are known as the function arguments. If you want to return multiple outputs, you can return a list containing any number of R objects.  User-defined functions are refered to as “closures” in R. A closure is made of a function and its environment. Closures are distinct from primitive functions, which are internally implemented."

In this case, we could let R give a warning when it tries to compute log10(x):\n\nval1 <- el10(-3)\n\nWe could instead produce our own warning message:\n\nel10 <- function(x) {\n  if (x < 0) warning(\"x must be positive\")\n  exp(log10(x))\n}\nval2 <- el10(-3)\nval2\n\n[1] NaN\n\n\nAs you see, the output (NaN) still gets returned.\nAlternatively, we can use stop() to end function execution:\n\nel10 <- function(x) {\n  if (x < 0) stop(\"x must be positive\")\n  exp(log10(x))\n}\nval3 <- el10(-3)\n\nError in el10(-3): x must be positive\n\n\nNote how, in this case, function evalutation is stopped and no value is returned."

This links back to the example seen earlier in the for loop section. In practice, this would be performed with the scale() command:\nWithin the for loop, we are assigning columns directly to the object initialized before the loop. In the following example, we use print(environment()) to print the environment outside and inside the loop function to show that it is the same. This is purely for demonstration:\n\n# initialize new object 'mtcars_z'\nmtcars_z <- mtcars\ncat(\"environment outside for loop is: \")\n\nenvironment outside for loop is: \n\nprint(environment())\n\n<environment: R_GlobalEnv>\n\n# z-score one column at a time in a for loop\nfor (i in 1:ncol(mtcars)) {\n  mtcars_z[, i] <- (mtcars[, i] - mean(mtcars[, i])) / sd(mtcars[, i])\n  cat(\"environment inside for loop is: \")\n  print(environment())\n}\n\nenvironment inside for loop is: <environment: R_GlobalEnv>\nenvironment inside for loop is: <environment: R_GlobalEnv>\nenvironment inside for loop is: <environment: R_GlobalEnv>\nenvironment inside for loop is: <environment: R_GlobalEnv>\nenvironment inside for loop is: <environment: R_GlobalEnv>\nenvironment inside for loop is: <environment: R_GlobalEnv>\nenvironment inside for loop is: <environment: R_GlobalEnv>\nenvironment inside for loop is: <environment: R_GlobalEnv>\nenvironment inside for loop is: <environment: R_GlobalEnv>\nenvironment inside for loop is: <environment: R_GlobalEnv>\nenvironment inside for loop is: <environment: R_GlobalEnv>\n\n\nIn contrast, all operations remain local within a function and the output must be returned:\n\nztransform <- function(x) {\n  cat(\"environment inside function body is: \")\n  print(environment())\n  z <- as.data.frame(sapply(mtcars, function(i) (i - mean(i))/sd(i)))\n  rownames(z) <- rownames(x)\n  z\n}\nmtcars_z2 <- ztransform(mtcars)\n\nenvironment inside function body is: <environment: 0x107f17f70>\n\ncat(\"environment outside function body is: \")\n\nenvironment outside function body is: \n\nprint(environment())\n\n<environment: R_GlobalEnv>\n\n\nNotice how the environment outside and inside the loop function is the same, it is the Global environemnt, but the environment within the function is different. That is why any objects created or changed within a function must be returned if we want to make them available."

Note that a number of other packages that endorse the use of pipes export the pipe operator as well.\nStarting with R version 4.1, a native pipe operator is included with the |> symbol.\nA pipe allows writing f(x) as x |> f() (native pipe) or x %>% f (magrittr).\nNote that the native pipe requires parentheses, but magrittr works with or without them.\nA pipe is often used to:\n\navoid multiple temporary assignments in a multistep procedure, or\nas an alternative to nesting functions.\n\nSome packages and developers promote its use, others discourage it. You should try and see if/when it suits your needs.\nThe following:\n\nx <- f1(x)\nx <- f2(x)\nx <- f3(x)\n\nis equivalent to:\n\nx <- f3(f2(f1(x)))\n\nis equivalent to:\n\nx <- x |> f1() |> f2() |> f3()\n\n\niris[, -5] |>\n  split(iris$Species) |>\n  lapply(function(i) sapply(i, mean))\n\n$setosa\nSepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width \n       5.006        3.428        1.462        0.246 \n\n$versicolor\nSepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width \n       5.936        2.770        4.260        1.326 \n\n$virginica\nSepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width \n       6.588        2.974        5.552        2.026 \n\n\nPipes are used extensively in the tidyverse packages and many other third-party packages.\nYou can learn more about the magrittr pipe operator in the vignette\n\n\n\nIn RStudio the keyboard shortcut for the pipe operator is Shift-Command-M (MacOS) or Ctrl-Shift-M (Windows)\n\n\n\n\n15.8.1 Differences between native pipe and magrittr\n\n\nnative pipe requires () after function name, magrittr works with or without them\n\n\nx <- rnorm(300)\n\n\nx |> mean()\n\n[1] 0.03382004\n\n\nbut this would fail:\n\nx |> mean\n\nwhile either works in magrittr\n\nlibrary(magrittr)\nx %>% mean()\n\n[1] 0.03382004\n\n\n\nx %>% mean\n\n[1] 0.03382004\n\n\n\nnative pipe by design only pipes its LHS to the first unnamed argument on the RHS. magrittr allows using a period . to pipe to any position on the RHS. The native pipe workaround is using an anonymous function (can use the new shorter syntax \\(x) instead of function(x))\n\ne.g.: Find the position of “r” in the latin alphabet\nIn this example, we want to pass the LHS to the second argument of grep().\nUsing native pipe, we name the first argument pattern and the LHS is passed to the first unnamed argument, i.e. the second (which is x, the character vector where matches are looked for)\n\nletters |> grep(pattern = \"r\")\n\n[1] 18\n\n\nwith magrittr you can use the dot notation to specify where to pipe into:\n\nletters %>% grep(\"r\", .)\n\n[1] 18\n\n\nFor demonstration, here’s the slightly involved way you would achieve this with an anonymous function and the native pipe. This may make sense for more complex calls.\n\nletters |> {\\(x) grep(\"r\", x)}()\n\n[1] 18"

In practice, you would use apply() on a matrix."

    "text": "16.9 Anonymous functions\nAnonymous functions are just like regular functions but they are not assigned to an object - i.e. they are not “named”.\nThey are usually passed as arguments to other functions to be used once, hence no need to name them.\nIn R, anonymous functions are often used with the apply family of functions.\nExample of a simple regular function:\n\nsquared <- function(x) {\n  x^2\n}\n\nBecause this is a short function definition, it can also be written in a single line without curly brackets:\n\nsquared <- function(x) x^2\n\nThe equivalent anonymous function is the same, but omitting the assignment:\n\nfunction(x) x^2\n\nfunction(x) x^2\n\n\nLet’s use the squared() function within sapply() to square the first four columns of the iris dataset. In these examples, we often wrap functions around head() which prints the first few lines of an object to avoid:\n\nhead(iris[, 1:4])\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4\n\niris_sq <- sapply(iris[, 1:4], squared)\nhead(iris_sq)\n\n     Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\n[1,]        26.01       12.25         1.96        0.04\n[2,]        24.01        9.00         1.96        0.04\n[3,]        22.09       10.24         1.69        0.04\n[4,]        21.16        9.61         2.25        0.04\n[5,]        25.00       12.96         1.96        0.04\n[6,]        29.16       15.21         2.89        0.16\n\n\nLet’s do the same as above, but this time using an anonymous function:\n\niris_sqtoo <- sapply(iris[, 1:4], function(x) x^2)\nhead(iris_sqtoo)\n\n     Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\n[1,]        26.01       12.25         1.96        0.04\n[2,]        24.01        9.00         1.96        0.04\n[3,]        22.09       10.24         1.69        0.04\n[4,]        21.16        9.61         2.25        0.04\n[5,]        25.00       12.96         1.96        0.04\n[6,]        29.16       15.21         2.89        0.16\n\n\nThe entire anonymous function definition is passed in the function argument (FUN in the R documentation)."

It accepts either - a single integer or a character specifying a column of the data.frame being created whose values should be used as row names, or - a vector of values (character or integer) of the row names to be used\nFor example, we can use the “PID” column:\n\ndf <- data.frame(PID = c(111:119),\n                 Hospital = c(\"UCSF\", \"HUP\", \"Stanford\",\n                             \"Stanford\", \"UCSF\", \"HUP\", \n                             \"HUP\", \"Stanford\", \"UCSF\"),\n                Age = c(22, 34, 41, 19, 53, 21, 63, 22, 19),\n                Sex = c(1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0),\n                row.names = \"PID\")\n\n\n\n\nIt is recommended to not use/depend on row names to identify or index data.frames, and instead include a column of case IDs.\n\n\n\nWe can get column names and row names with colnames() and rownames(), respectively:\n\ncolnames(df)\n\n[1] \"Hospital\" \"Age\"      \"Sex\"     \n\nrownames(df)\n\n[1] \"111\" \"112\" \"113\" \"114\" \"115\" \"116\" \"117\" \"118\" \"119\"\n\n\nTo set new column or row names use the form:\ncolnames(df) <- new.colnames\nrownames(df) <- new.rownames\nwhere new.colnames and new.rownames is a character vector.\nYou can rename all columns/rows or use indexing to replace specific names:\nRename all rows:\n\nrownames(df) <- paste0(\"Patient_\", 1:9)\ndf\n\n          Hospital Age Sex\nPatient_1     UCSF  22   1\nPatient_2      HUP  34   1\nPatient_3 Stanford  41   0\nPatient_4 Stanford  19   1\nPatient_5     UCSF  53   0\nPatient_6      HUP  21   0\nPatient_7      HUP  63   1\nPatient_8 Stanford  22   0\nPatient_9     UCSF  19   0\n\n\nRename first two columns:\n\ncolnames(df)[1:2] <- c(\"Center\", \"Age_at_Dx\")\ndf\n\n            Center Age_at_Dx Sex\nPatient_1     UCSF        22   1\nPatient_2      HUP        34   1\nPatient_3 Stanford        41   0\nPatient_4 Stanford        19   1\nPatient_5     UCSF        53   0\nPatient_6      HUP        21   0\nPatient_7      HUP        63   1\nPatient_8 Stanford        22   0\nPatient_9     UCSF        19   0"

Table joins allow you to specify how to perform such a merge.\nScenario: You have received two tables with clinical data. Each table contains a column with a unique identifier (ID) plus a number of variables which are unique to each table. You want to merge them into one big table so that for each ID you have all available variables. You want to make sure that the same ID number (e.g. 108) corresponds to the same case in both datasets, but not all IDs needs to be present in both datasets.\nLet’s make up some synthetic data:\nThere are four main types of join operations:"

If the two datasets’ ID column has a different name, e.g. “PatientID” in one and “PID” in the other, you can either rename one of them, or probably best, use the following syntax:\nmerge(x, y, by.x, by.y)\nwhere by.x should be the name of the ID column for the x dataset and by.y should be the name of the ID column for the y dataset.\nIf you do not specify by or by.x and by.y arguments, merge() defaults to using the intersection of column names of the two input datasets. Look at the merge()’s documentation:\nby = intersect(names(x), names(y))\nIn our example datasets above, this works as expected and identifies “PID” as the common column:\n\nintersect(names(a), names(b))\n\n[1] \"PID\""

Take a moment to notice how the wide table on the left with 3 cases (3 IDs) and 3 variables gets converted from a 3 x 4 table to a 9 x 3 long table on the right. The values (outlined in magenta) are present once in each table: on the wide table they form an ID x Variable matrix, while on the long they are stacked on a single column. The IDs have to be repeated on the long table, once for each variable and there is a new ‘Variable’ column to provide the information present in the wide table’s column names.\nA wide dataset contains only a single row per case (e.g. patient), while a long dataset can contain multiple rows per case (e.g. for multiple timepoints). We want to be able to reshape from one form to the other because different programs (e.g. statistical models, visualization) may expect data in one of the other format for different applications (e.g. longitudinal modeling or grouped visualizations)."

A scaled vector therefore has standard deviation equal to 1.\nCentering of a numeric vector is achieved by elementwise subtraction of its mean. A centered vector therefore has mean equal to 0.\nStandardizing, a.k.a. converting to Z-scores, involves scaling and centering. Scaling and centering is performed in R with the scale() function.\nDepending on your modeling needs / the algorithms you plan to use, it is often important to scale and/or center your data. Note that many functions, but not all, may automatically scale and center data internally if it is required by the algorithm. Check the function documentation to see if you should manually scale or not.\nscale() can be applied to a single vector or a matrix/data.frame. In the case of a matrix or data.frame, scaling is applied on each column individually. By default, both arguments scale and center are set to TRUE.\nScale a vector:\n\nhead(iris$Sepal.Length)\n\n[1] 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5.0 5.4\n\nPetal.Length_scaled <- scale(iris$Petal.Length)\nhead(Petal.Length_scaled)\n\n          [,1]\n[1,] -1.335752\n[2,] -1.335752\n[3,] -1.392399\n[4,] -1.279104\n[5,] -1.335752\n[6,] -1.165809\n\n\nScale multiple columns of a matrix/data.frame:\n\niris.scaled <- scale(iris[, -5])\nhead(iris.scaled)\n\n     Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\n[1,]   -0.8976739  1.01560199    -1.335752   -1.311052\n[2,]   -1.1392005 -0.13153881    -1.335752   -1.311052\n[3,]   -1.3807271  0.32731751    -1.392399   -1.311052\n[4,]   -1.5014904  0.09788935    -1.279104   -1.311052\n[5,]   -1.0184372  1.24503015    -1.335752   -1.311052\n[6,]   -0.5353840  1.93331463    -1.165809   -1.048667\n\n\nFirst, let’s verify that scale() did what we wanted:\n\ncolMeans(iris.scaled)\n\n Sepal.Length   Sepal.Width  Petal.Length   Petal.Width \n-1.457168e-15 -1.638319e-15 -1.292300e-15 -5.543714e-16 \n\n\n\napply(iris.scaled, 2, sd)\n\nSepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width \n           1            1            1            1 \n\n\nWe got effectively 0 mean and standard deviation of 1 for each column.\nscale() outputs the scaled vector(s) along with the scaling and/or centering parameters saved as attributes in the output.\nNote that in both cases, whether a vector input or data.frame, the output is a matrix:\n\nclass(Petal.Length_scaled)\n\n[1] \"matrix\" \"array\" \n\nclass(iris.scaled)\n\n[1] \"matrix\" \"array\" \n\n\nGet the output attributes:\n\nattributes(Petal.Length_scaled)\n\n$dim\n[1] 150   1\n\n$`scaled:center`\n[1] 3.758\n\n$`scaled:scale`\n[1] 1.765298\n\n\ncenter is the mean:\n\nmean(iris$Petal.Length)\n\n[1] 3.758\n\n\nscale is the standard deviation:\n\nsd(iris$Petal.Length)\n\n[1] 1.765298\n\n\nFor a matrix/data.frame input, you get center and scale attributes per column:\n\nattributes(iris.scaled)\n\n$dim\n[1] 150   4\n\n$dimnames\n$dimnames[[1]]\nNULL\n\n$dimnames[[2]]\n[1] \"Sepal.Length\" \"Sepal.Width\"  \"Petal.Length\" \"Petal.Width\" \n\n\n$`scaled:center`\nSepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width \n    5.843333     3.057333     3.758000     1.199333 \n\n$`scaled:scale`\nSepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width \n   0.8280661    0.4358663    1.7652982    0.7622377 \n\n\nLet’s save the scale and center attributes and then double check the calculations:\n\n.center <- attr(iris.scaled, \"scaled:center\")\n.center\n\nSepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width \n    5.843333     3.057333     3.758000     1.199333 \n\n.scale <- attr(iris.scaled, \"scaled:scale\")\n.scale\n\nSepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width \n   0.8280661    0.4358663    1.7652982    0.7622377 \n\nSepal.Length_scaled <- (iris$Sepal.Length - .center[1]) / .scale[1]\nall(Sepal.Length_scaled == iris.scaled[, \"Sepal.Length\"])\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nNote: Due to limitation in numerical precision, checking sets of floats for equality after multiple operations is not recommended.

A log transform can help here:\n\nmplot3_x(log(x))\n\n\n\n\n\n20.1.4 Data binning with cut()\n\nA different approach for the above variable might be to bin it.\nLet’s look at a few different ways to bin continuous data.\n\n20.1.4.1 Evenly-spaced interval\ncut() allows us to bin a numeric variable into evenly-spaced intervals.\nThe breaks argument defines the number of intervals:\n\nx_cut4 <- cut(x, breaks = 4)\nhead(x_cut4)\n\n[1] (0.291,178] (0.291,178] (0.291,178] (0.291,178] (0.291,178] (0.291,178]\nLevels: (0.291,178] (178,355] (355,533] (533,711]\n\ntable(x_cut4)\n\nx_cut4\n(0.291,178]   (178,355]   (355,533]   (533,711] \n        977          19           3           1 \n\n\n\n\n\nInterval Notation\n\n\n[3, 9) represents the interval of real numbers between 3 and 9, including 3 and excluding 9.\n\n\n\nBecause the data is so skewed, equal intervals are not helpful in this case. The majority of the data points get grouped into a single bin.\nLet’s visualize the cuts:\n\nxcuts5 <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = 5)\nxcuts5\n\n[1]   1.0000 178.2453 355.4905 532.7358 709.9811\n\n\n\nmplot3_x(x, par.reset = FALSE)\n# plot(density(x)) # in base R\nabline(v = xcuts5, col = \"red\", lwd = 1.5)\n\n\n\n\n[Note: We used par.reset = FALSE to stop mplot3_x() from resetting its custom par() settings so that we can continue adding elements to the same plot, in this case with the abline() command.]\n\n20.1.4.2 Quantile cuts\nInstead of evenly-spaced intervals, we can get quantiles with quantile(). We ask for 5 quantiles using the length.out argument, which corresponds to 4 intervals:\n\nxquants5 <- quantile(x, seq(0, 1, length.out = 5))\nxquants5 <- quantile(x, seq(0, 1, length.out = 5))\nmplot3_x(x, par.reset = F)\n# plot(density(x)) # in base R\nabline(v = xquants5, col = \"green\", lwd = 1.5)\n\n\n\n\nThe breaks argument of cut() allows us to pass either an integer to define the number of evenly-spaced breaks, or a numeric vector defining the position of breaks.\nWe can therefore pass the quantile values as break points.\nSince the quantile values begin at the lowest value in the data, we need to define include.lowest = TRUE so that the first interval is inclusive of the lowest value:\n\nx_cutq4 <- cut(x, breaks = xquants5, include.lowest = TRUE)\ntable(x_cutq4)\n\nx_cutq4\n   [1,11.5] (11.5,23.2] (23.2,47.2]  (47.2,710] \n        250         250         250         250 \n\n\nWith quantile cuts, each bin contains roughly the same number of observations (+/- 1)."

    "text": "20.2 Categorical variables\nMany algorithms (or their implementations) do not directly support categorical variables. To use them, you must therefore convert all categorical variables to some type of numerical encoding.\n\n20.2.1 Integer encoding\nIf the categorical data is ordinal, you can simply convert it to integers.\nFor example, the following ordered factor:\n\nbrightness <- factor(c(\"bright\", \"brightest\", \"darkest\",\n                        \"bright\", \"dark\", \"dim\", \"dark\"),\n                      levels = c(\"darkest\", \"dark\", \"dim\", \"bright\", \"brightest\"),\n                      ordered = TRUE)\nbrightness\n\n[1] bright    brightest darkest   bright    dark      dim       dark     \nLevels: darkest < dark < dim < bright < brightest\n\n\n…can be directly coerced to an integer:\n\nas.integer(brightness)\n\n[1] 4 5 1 4 2 3 2\n\n\n\n20.2.2 One-hot encoding\nWhen categorical features are not ordinal, and your algorithm cannot handle them directly, you can one-hot encode them. In one-hot encoding, each categorical feature is converted to k binary features, where k = number of unique values in the input, such that only one feature has the value 1 per case. This is similar to creating dummy variables in statistics, with the difference that dummy variables create k - 1 new variables.\n\nset.seed(21)\nadmission_reasons <- c(\"plannedSurgery\", \"emergencySurgery\", \"medical\")\nadmission <- sample(admission_reasons, 12, T)\nadmission\n\n [1] \"medical\"          \"plannedSurgery\"   \"medical\"          \"plannedSurgery\"  \n [5] \"emergencySurgery\" \"medical\"          \"plannedSurgery\"   \"medical\"         \n [9] \"medical\"          \"emergencySurgery\" \"emergencySurgery\" \"emergencySurgery\"\n\n\nMultiple packages include functions that perform one-hot encoding. It’s a simple operation and we don’t necessarily need to install a large package with many dependencies.\nLet’s write a simple function to perform one-hot encoding. (Note: you may have heard that for loops can be slow in R, but that depends on the operations performed. Here, we loop over an integer matrix and it is plenty fast)\n\nonehot <- function(x, xname = NULL) {\n  if (is.null(xname)) xname <- deparse(substitute(x))\n  x <- factor(x)\n  .levels <- levels(x)      # Get factor levels\n  ncases <- NROW(x)         # Get number of cases\n  index <- as.integer(x)    # Convert levels to integer\n  oh <- matrix(0, ncases, length(.levels))   # Initialize zeros matrix\n  colnames(oh) <- paste(xname, .levels, sep = \"_\")  # Name columns by levels\n  for (i in seq(ncases)) oh[i, index[i]] <- 1  # Assign \"1\" to appropriate level\n  oh\n}\n\nLet’s apply our new function to the admission vector:\n\nonehot(admission)\n\n      admission_emergencySurgery admission_medical admission_plannedSurgery\n [1,]                          0                 1                        0\n [2,]                          0                 0                        1\n [3,]                          0                 1                        0\n [4,]                          0                 0                        1\n [5,]                          1                 0                        0\n [6,]                          0                 1                        0\n [7,]                          0                 0                        1\n [8,]                          0                 1                        0\n [9,]                          0                 1                        0\n[10,]                          1                 0                        0\n[11,]                          1                 0                        0\n[12,]                          1                 0                        0\n\n\nNote: deparse(substitute(x)) above is used to automatically get the name of the input object (in this case “admission”). This is similar to how many of R’s internal functions (e.g. plot()) get the names of input objects."

Remember that the output of is.na() is a logical matrix with the same dimensions as the dataset:\n\nna_index <- is.na(dat)\ndim(na_index)\n\n[1] 768   9\n\nhead(na_index)\n\n  pregnant glucose pressure triceps insulin  mass pedigree   age diabetes\n1    FALSE   FALSE    FALSE   FALSE    TRUE FALSE    FALSE FALSE    FALSE\n2    FALSE   FALSE    FALSE   FALSE    TRUE FALSE    FALSE FALSE    FALSE\n3    FALSE   FALSE    FALSE    TRUE    TRUE FALSE    FALSE FALSE    FALSE\n4    FALSE   FALSE    FALSE   FALSE   FALSE FALSE    FALSE FALSE    FALSE\n5    FALSE   FALSE    FALSE   FALSE   FALSE FALSE    FALSE FALSE    FALSE\n6    FALSE   FALSE    FALSE    TRUE    TRUE FALSE    FALSE FALSE    FALSE\n\n\nOne way to count missing values is with sum(is.na()). Remember that a logical array is coerced to an integer array for mathematical operations, where TRUE becomes 1 and FALSE becomes 0. Therefore, calling sum() on a logical index counts the number of TRUE elements (and since we are applying it on the index of NA values, it counts the number of elements with missing values):\n\nsum(is.na(dat))\n\n[1] 652\n\n\nThere are 652 NA values in total in the data.frame.\nLet’s count the number of missing values per feature, i.e. per column, using sapply()(#sapply):\n\nsapply(dat, function(i) sum(is.na(i)))\n\npregnant  glucose pressure  triceps  insulin     mass pedigree      age \n       0        5       35      227      374       11        0        0 \ndiabetes \n       0 \n\n\nThe features insulin and triceps have the most NA values.\nLet’s count the number of missing values per case (i.e. row):\n\nsapply(1:nrow(dat), function(i) sum(is.na(dat[i, ])))\n\n  [1] 1 1 2 0 0 2 0 3 0 3 2 2 2 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 1 0 2\n [38] 1 1 0 0 2 1 0 2 1 2 1 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 4 2 2 0 2 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 2 0\n [75] 1 2 2 1 3 1 1 4 0 1 2 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n[112] 0 0 2 0 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 1 0 2 0 2 1 0\n[149] 2 1 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 2 2\n[186] 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 3 1 0 2 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 2\n[223] 3 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 1 1 2 1 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 2 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n[260] 0 0 3 1 1 2 0 3 1 2 3 1 0 2 0 2 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n[297] 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 2 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 3\n[334] 2 0 0 3 2 0 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 3 0 2 2 2 1 0 2 2 0 2 0 0 0 2 1 2 0 0 2 1 0 0\n[371] 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 1 2 2 0 1 2 0 2\n[408] 2 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4 0 0 0 3 0 0 2 1 3 1 2 1 2 1 0 0 2\n[445] 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 2 0 0 0 3 0 1 1 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 1 0\n[482] 1 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 1 0 4 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 0 2 1 0 2 2 0 0 0 2\n[519] 2 0 0 0 4 2 2 1 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 3 0 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 2 0 0\n[556] 0 1 2 1 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 3 1 0\n[593] 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 1 3 1 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 2 0 1 3 0 1 2 0 2 0 2 2 2\n[630] 1 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 1 0 0 1 0\n[667] 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 1 0 2 3 0 2 1 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 2 0 1 1\n[704] 3 0 1 4 0 2 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 1 0 1 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 1 0 2\n[741] 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 2 2 0 1 0 1 0 1 2 2 2 0 1 2 0 1 0 2 1\n\n\nIf we wanted to get the row with the most missing values, we can use which.max():\n\nwhich.max(sapply(1:nrow(dat), function(i) sum(is.na(dat[i, ]))))\n\n[1] 50\n\n\n\nsum(is.na(dat[50, ]))\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nRow 50 has 4 missing values.\n\n21.1.1 Visualize\nIt may be helpful to visualize missing data to get a quick impression of missingness.

That’s quite a few, so, for this dataset, we probably want to look at options that do not exclude cases.\n\n21.2.3 Replace with a fixed value\nWe can manually replace missing values with the mean or median in the case of a continuous variable, or with the mode in the case of a categorical feature.\nFor example, to replace the first feature’s missing values with the mean:\n\npressure_mean <- mean(dat$pressure, na.rm = TRUE)\ndat_im <- dat\ndat_im$pressure[is.na(dat_im$pressure)] <- pressure_mean\n\nrtemis::preprocess() can replace missing values with mean (for numeric features) and the mode (for factors) for all columns:\n\ndat_pre <- preprocess(dat, impute = TRUE, impute.type = \"meanMode\")\n[2022-08-28 19:29:22 preprocess] Imputing missing values using mean and getMode... \n[2022-08-28 19:29:22 preprocess] Done \n\n\nVerify there are no missing data by rerunning checkData():\n\ncheckData(dat_pre)\n dat_pre: A data.frame with 768 rows and 9 features\n\n  Data types________________\n  * 8 continuous features\n  * 0 integer features\n  * 1 categorical feature, which is not ordered\n  * 0 character features\n  * 0 date features\n\n  Issues____________________\n  * 0 constant features\n  * 0 duplicated cases\n  * 0 features include 'NA' values\n\n  Recommendations___________\n  * Everything looks good\n\n\nYou may want to include a “missingness” column that indicates which cases were imputed to include in your model. You can create this simply by running:\n\npressure_missing = factor(as.integer(is.na(dat$pressure)))\n\npreprocess() includes the option missingness to add indicator columns after imputation:\n\ndat_pre <- preprocess(dat, impute = TRUE, impute.type = \"meanMode\",\n                      missingness = TRUE)\n[2022-08-28 19:29:22 preprocess] Created missingness indicator for glucose... \n[2022-08-28 19:29:22 preprocess] Created missingness indicator for pressure... \n[2022-08-28 19:29:22 preprocess] Created missingness indicator for triceps... \n[2022-08-28 19:29:22 preprocess] Created missingness indicator for insulin... \n[2022-08-28 19:29:22 preprocess] Created missingness indicator for mass... \n[2022-08-28 19:29:22 preprocess] Imputing missing values using mean and getMode... \n[2022-08-28 19:29:22 preprocess] Done \n\nhead(dat_pre)\n\n  pregnant glucose pressure  triceps  insulin mass pedigree age diabetes\n1        6     148       72 35.00000 155.5482 33.6    0.627  50      pos\n2        1      85       66 29.00000 155.5482 26.6    0.351  31      neg\n3        8     183       64 29.15342 155.5482 23.3    0.672  32      pos\n4        1      89       66 23.00000  94.0000 28.1    0.167  21      neg\n5        0     137       40 35.00000 168.0000 43.1    2.288  33      pos\n6        5     116       74 29.15342 155.5482 25.6    0.201  30      neg\n  glucose_missing pressure_missing triceps_missing insulin_missing mass_missing\n1               0                0               0               1            0\n2               0                0               0               1            0\n3               0                0               1               1            0\n4               0                0               0               0            0\n5               0                0               0               0            0\n6               0                0               1               1            0\n\n\n\n21.2.3.1 Add new level “missing”\nOne option to handle missing data in categorical variables, is to introduce a new level of “missing” to the factor, instead of replacing with the mode, for example. If we bin a continuous variable to convert to categorical, the same can then also be applied.\nSince no factors have missing values in the current dataset we create a copy and replace some data with NA:\n\ndat2 <- dat\ndat2$diabetes[sample(1:NROW(dat2), 35)] <- NA\nsum(is.na(dat2$diabetes))\n\n[1] 35\n\nlevels(dat2$diabetes)\n\n[1] \"neg\" \"pos\"\n\n\nReplace NA values with new level missing:\n\ndat_pre2 <- preprocess(dat2, factorNA2missing = TRUE)\n[2022-08-28 19:29:22 preprocess] Converting NA in factors to level \"missing\"... \n[2022-08-28 19:29:22 preprocess] Done \n\nanyNA(dat_pre2$diabetes)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nlevels(dat_pre2$diabetes)\n\n[1] \"neg\"     \"pos\"     \"missing\"\n\n\n\n21.2.4 Last observation carried forward (LOCF)\nIn longitudinal / timeseries data, we may want to replace missing values with the last observed value. This is called last observation carried forward (LOCF). As always, whether this procedure is appropriate depend the reasons for missingness. The zoo and DescTool packages provide commands to perform LOCF.\nSome simulated data. We are missing blood pressure measurements on Saturdays and Sundays:\n\ndat <- data.frame(Day = rep(c(\"Mon\", \"Tues\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\", \"Sun\"), 3),\n                  SBP = sample(105:125, 21, TRUE))\ndat$SBP[dat$Day == \"Sat\" | dat$Day == \"Sun\"] <- NA\ndat\n\n    Day SBP\n1   Mon 120\n2  Tues 113\n3   Wed 120\n4   Thu 113\n5   Fri 116\n6   Sat  NA\n7   Sun  NA\n8   Mon 116\n9  Tues 108\n10  Wed 115\n11  Thu 107\n12  Fri 105\n13  Sat  NA\n14  Sun  NA\n15  Mon 120\n16 Tues 114\n17  Wed 115\n18  Thu 125\n19  Fri 111\n20  Sat  NA\n21  Sun  NA\n\n\nThe zoo package includes the na.locf().\n\ndat$SBPlocf <- zoo::na.locf(dat$SBP)\ndat\n\n    Day SBP SBPlocf\n1   Mon 120     120\n2  Tues 113     113\n3   Wed 120     120\n4   Thu 113     113\n5   Fri 116     116\n6   Sat  NA     116\n7   Sun  NA     116\n8   Mon 116     116\n9  Tues 108     108\n10  Wed 115     115\n11  Thu 107     107\n12  Fri 105     105\n13  Sat  NA     105\n14  Sun  NA     105\n15  Mon 120     120\n16 Tues 114     114\n17  Wed 115     115\n18  Thu 125     125\n19  Fri 111     111\n20  Sat  NA     111\n21  Sun  NA     111\n\n\nSimilar functionality is included in DescTools’ LOCF() function:\n\nDescTools::LOCF(dat$SBP)\n\n [1] 120 113 120 113 116 116 116 116 108 115 107 105 105 105 120 114 115 125 111\n[20] 111 111\n\n\n\n21.2.5 Replace missing values with estimated values\n\n21.2.5.1 Single imputation\nYou can use non-missing data to predict missing data in an iterative procedure (Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2010; Stekhoven and Bühlmann 2012). The missRanger package uses the optimized (and parallel-capable) package ranger (Wright and Ziegler 2015) to iteratively train random forest models for imputation.\n\nlibrary(missRanger)\ndat <- iris\nset.seed(2020)\ndat[sample(1:150, 5), 1] <- dat[sample(1:150, 22), 4] <- dat[sample(1:150, 18), 4] <- NA\ndat_rfimp <- missRanger(dat, num.trees = 100)\n\n\nMissing value imputation by random forests\n\n  Variables to impute:      Sepal.Length, Petal.Width\n  Variables used to impute: Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, Species\niter 1: ..\niter 2: ..\niter 3: ..\niter 4: ..\n\nhead(dat_rfimp)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1     5.100000         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2     4.900000         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3     4.732533         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4     4.600000         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5     5.000000         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6     5.400000         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\ncheckData(dat_rfimp)\n dat_rfimp: A data.frame with 150 rows and 5 features\n\n  Data types________________\n  * 4 continuous features\n  * 0 integer features\n  * 1 categorical feature, which is not ordered\n     - 1 unordered categorical feature has more than 2 levels\n  * 0 character features\n  * 0 date features\n\n  Issues____________________\n  * 0 constant features\n  * 1 duplicated case\n  * 0 features include 'NA' values\n\n  Recommendations___________\n  * Remove the duplicated case\n  * Check the unordered categorical feature with more than 2 levels and consider\n    if ordering would make sense\n\n\nNote: The default method for preprocess(impute = TRUE) is to use missRanger.\n\n21.2.5.2 Multiple imputation\nMultiple imputation creates multiple estimates of the missing data. It is more statistically valid for small datasets, especially when the goal is to get accurate estimates of a summary statistics, but may not be practical for larger datasets. It is not usually considered an option for machine learning (where duplicating cases may add bias and complexity in resampling). The package mice is a popular choice for multiple imputation in R.\n\nlibrary(mice)\ndat_mice <- mice(dat)\n\n\n\n\n\nBuuren, S van, and Karin Groothuis-Oudshoorn. 2010. “Mice: Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations in r.” Journal of Statistical Software, 1–68.\n\n\nMack, Christina, Zhaohui Su, and Daniel Westreich. 2018. “Managing Missing Data in Patient Registries: Addendum to Registries for Evaluating Patient Outcomes: A User’s Guide, [Internet].”\n\n\nStekhoven, Daniel J, and Peter Bühlmann. 2012. “MissForest—Non-Parametric Missing Value Imputation for Mixed-Type Data.” Bioinformatics 28 (1): 112–18.\n\n\nWright, Marvin N, and Andreas Ziegler. 2015. “Ranger: A Fast Implementation of Random Forests for High Dimensional Data in c++ and r.” arXiv Preprint arXiv:1508.04409."

    "section": "\n22.9 Regular expressions",
    "text": "22.9 Regular expressions\nRegular expressions allow you to perform flexible pattern matching. For example, you can look for a pattern specifically at the beginning or the end of a word, or for a variable pattern with certain characteristics.\nRegular expressions are very powerful and heavily used. They exist in multiple programming languages - with many similarities and some differences in their syntax.\nThere are many rules in defining regular expressions and take a little getting used to. You can read the R manual by typing ?base::regex.\nSome of the most important rules are liste below:\n\n22.9.1 Match a pattern at the beginning of a line/string with ^/\\\\<:\nUse the caret sign ^ in the beginning of a pattern to only match strings that begin with this pattern.\npattern 012 matches both 2nd and 3rd elements:\n\nx <- c(\"001xyz993\", \"012qwe764\", \"029aqw012\")\nx\n\n[1] \"001xyz993\" \"012qwe764\" \"029aqw012\"\n\ngrep(\"012\", x)\n\n[1] 2 3\n\n\nBy adding ^ or \\\\<, only the 2nd element matches:\n\ngrep(\"^012\", x)\n\n[1] 2\n\ngrep(\"\\\\<012\", x)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n22.9.2 Match a pattern at the end of a line/string with $/\\\\>\n\nThe dollar sign $ is used at the end of a pattern to only match strings which end with this pattern:\n\nx\n\n[1] \"001xyz993\" \"012qwe764\" \"029aqw012\"\n\ngrep(\"012$\", x)\n\n[1] 3\n\ngrep(\"012\\\\>\", x)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\nx <- c(\"1one\", \"2one\", \"3two\", \"3three\")\ngrep(\"one$\", x)\n\n[1] 1 2\n\ngrep(\"one\\\\>\", x)\n\n[1] 1 2\n\n\n\n22.9.3 .: Match any character\n\ngrep(\"e.X\", c(\"eX\", \"enX\", \"ennX\", \"ennnX\", \"ennnnX\"))\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n22.9.4 +: Match preceding character one or more times:\n\ngrep(\"en+X\", c(\"eX\", \"enX\", \"ennX\", \"ennnX\", \"ennnnX\"))\n\n[1] 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n22.9.5 {n}: Match preceding character n times:\n\ngrep(\"en{2}X\", c(\"eX\", \"enX\", \"ennX\", \"ennnX\", \"ennnnX\"))\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n22.9.6 {n,}: Match preceding character n or more times:\n\ngrep(\"en{2,}X\", c(\"eX\", \"enX\", \"ennX\", \"ennnX\", \"ennnnX\"))\n\n[1] 3 4 5\n\n\n\n22.9.7 {n,m}: Match preceding character at least n times and no more than m times:\n\ngrep(\"en{2,3}X\", c(\"eX\", \"enX\", \"ennX\", \"ennnX\", \"ennnnX\"))\n\n[1] 3 4\n\n\n\n22.9.8 Character classes\nYou can define a set of characters to be matched using square brackets. Any number of the characters in the set will be matched.\nFor example match and replace $ and/or @ with an underscore:\n\nx <- c(\"Feat1$alpha\", \"Feat2$gamma@5\", \"Feat9@zeta2\")\ngsub(\"[$@]\", \"_\", x)\n\n[1] \"Feat1_alpha\"   \"Feat2_gamma_5\" \"Feat9_zeta2\"  \n\n\n\n22.9.8.1 Predefined character classes\nA number of character classes are predefined. Slightly confusingly, they are themselves surrounded by brackets and to use them as a character class, you need a seconds set of brackets around them. Some of the most common ones include:\n\n\n[:alnum:]: alphanumeric, i.e. all letters and numbers\n\n[:alpha:]: all letters\n\n[:digit:]: all numbers\n\n[:lower:]: all lowercase letters\n\n[:upper:]: all uppercase letters\n\n[:punct:]: all punctuation characters (! ” # $ % & ’ ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [  ] ^ _ ` { | } ~.)\n\n[:blank:]: all spaces and tabs\n\n[:space:]: all spaces, tabs, newline characters, and some more\n\nLet’s look at some examples using them.\nHere we use [:digit:] to remove all numbers:\n\nx <- c(\"001Emergency\", \"010Cardiology\", \"018Neurology\", \"020Anesthesia\", \n       \"021Surgery\", \"051Psychiatry\")\nx\n\n[1] \"001Emergency\"  \"010Cardiology\" \"018Neurology\"  \"020Anesthesia\"\n[5] \"021Surgery\"    \"051Psychiatry\"\n\ngsub(\"[[:digit:]]\", \"\", x)\n\n[1] \"Emergency\"  \"Cardiology\" \"Neurology\"  \"Anesthesia\" \"Surgery\"   \n[6] \"Psychiatry\"\n\n\nWe can use [:alpha:] to remove all letters instead:\n\ngsub(\"[[:alpha:]]\", \"\", x)\n\n[1] \"001\" \"010\" \"018\" \"020\" \"021\" \"051\"\n\n\nWe can use a caret ^ in the beginning of a character class to match any character not in the character set:\n\nx <- c(\"001$Emergency\", \"010@Cardiology\", \"018*Neurology\", \"020!Anesthesia\", \n       \"021!Surgery\", \"051*Psychiatry\")\ngsub(\"[^[:alnum:]]\", \"_\", x)\n\n[1] \"001_Emergency\"  \"010_Cardiology\" \"018_Neurology\"  \"020_Anesthesia\"\n[5] \"021_Surgery\"    \"051_Psychiatry\"\n\n\n\n22.9.9 Combining character classes\nUse | to match from multiple character classes:\n\nx <- c(\"123#$%alphaBeta\")\ngsub(\"[[:digit:]|[:punct:]]\", \"\", x)\n\n[1] \"alphaBeta\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on regular expressions, start by reading the built-in documentation: ?regex\n\n\n\n\n22.9.10 Escaping metacharacters\nMetacharacters are characters that have a special meaning within a regular expression. They include:\n. \\ | ( ) [ { ^ $ * + ?.\nFor example, we have seen above that the period matches any character and the square brackets are used to define character classes If you want to match one of these characters itself, you must “escape” it using a double backslash. Escaping a character simply means “this is not part of a regular expression, match it as is”.\nFor example, to match a period (.) and replace it with underscores:\n\nx <- c(\"systolic.blood.pressure\", \"diastolic.blood.pressure\")\nx\n\n[1] \"systolic.blood.pressure\"  \"diastolic.blood.pressure\"\n\ngsub(\"\\\\.\", \"_\", x)\n\n[1] \"systolic_blood_pressure\"  \"diastolic_blood_pressure\"\n\n\nIf we didn’t escape the period above, it would have matched every character:\n\ngsub(\".\", \"_\", x)\n\n[1] \"_______________________\"  \"________________________\"\n\n\nAnother example, include an escaped metacharacter within a regular expression. In the example below we want to remove everything up to and including the dollar sign:\n\nx <- c(\"df$ID\", \"df$Age\")\ngsub(\".*\\\\$\", \"\", x)\n\n[1] \"ID\"  \"Age\"\n\n\nOur regular expression .*\\\\$, decomposed:\n\n\n.: match any character\n\n.*: match any character any number of times\n\n.*\\\\$: match any character any number of times till you find a dollar sign\n\nIf we had not escaped the $, it wouldn’t have worked:\n\ngsub(\".*$\", \"\", x)\n\n[1] \"\" \"\""

RC and R6 methods are part of the object, but you can (and should) write generic functions for them as well.\nThis chapter will focus on the ubiquitous S3 system. For more advanced (and real OOP) applications, we recommend looking into the R6 system."

    "text": "24.1 S3\nMost R objects we have been using so far are S3 objects. Data frames are some of the most common S3 objects.\nGeneric functions are functions that act differently based on the class of the input object. We have already used many of them. For example, summary() works differently on a data.frame, on a factor, or a glm object, etc.\nGeneric functions in R are saved as functionname.classname() and called automatically, based on the class of the first argument. This allows the same function, e.g. print(), summary(), c(), to have a different effect on objects of different classes. For example, the print() function applied on a data frame, will actually call print.data.frame(), while applied on a factor, it will call print.factor().\nThis means that when you type print(iris) this calls print.data.frame(iris)\nNote how the R documentation lists usage information separately for each S3 method, e.g. ## S3 method for class 'factor'\n\n24.1.1 methods()\n\nTo get a list of all available methods defined for a specific class,\ni.e. “What different functions can I use on this object?”\n\nmethods(class = \"data.frame\")\n\n [1] [             [[            [[<-          [<-           $<-          \n [6] aggregate     anyDuplicated anyNA         as.data.frame as.list      \n[11] as.matrix     as.vector     by            cbind         coerce       \n[16] dim           dimnames      dimnames<-    droplevels    duplicated   \n[21] edit          format        formula       head          initialize   \n[26] is.na         Math          merge         na.exclude    na.omit      \n[31] Ops           plot          print         prompt        rbind        \n[36] row.names     row.names<-   rowsum        show          slotsFromS3  \n[41] split         split<-       stack         str           subset       \n[46] summary       Summary       t             tail          transform    \n[51] type.convert  unique        unstack       within        xtfrm        \nsee '?methods' for accessing help and source code\n\n\nConversely, to get a list of all available methods for a generic function (i.e. which classes have)\n(i.e. “What objects can I use this function on?”)\n\nmethods(generic.function = \"plot\")\n\n [1] plot.acf*           plot.data.frame*    plot.decomposed.ts*\n [4] plot.default        plot.dendrogram*    plot.density*      \n [7] plot.ecdf           plot.factor*        plot.formula*      \n[10] plot.function       plot.hclust*        plot.histogram*    \n[13] plot.HoltWinters*   plot.isoreg*        plot.lm*           \n[16] plot.medpolish*     plot.mlm*           plot.ppr*          \n[19] plot.prcomp*        plot.princomp*      plot.profile.nls*  \n[22] plot.raster*        plot.spec*          plot.stepfun       \n[25] plot.stl*           plot.table*         plot.ts            \n[28] plot.tskernel*      plot.TukeyHSD*     \nsee '?methods' for accessing help and source code\n\n\n\n24.1.2 Defining custom S3 classes\nIt very simple to assign an object to a new class.\nThere is no formal class definition, an object is directly assigned to a class by name. An object can belong to multiple classes:\n\nx <- 1:10\nclass(x) <- c(\"specialvector\", \"numeric\")\nclass(x)\n\n[1] \"specialvector\" \"numeric\"      \n\n\nThe hierarchy of classes goes left to right, meaning that generic methods are searched for classes in the order they appear in the output of class().\nIf we print x, since there is no print method for class specialvector or for numeric, the default print.default() command is automatically called:\n\nprint(x)\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"specialvector\" \"numeric\"      \n\nprint.default(x)\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"specialvector\" \"numeric\"      \n\n\nTo create a custom print() function for out new class specialvector, we define a function named print.[classname]:\n\nprint.specialvector <- function(x, ...) {\n  cat(\"This is a special vector of length\", length(x), \"\\n\")\n  cat(\"Its mean value is\", mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), \"and its median is\", median(x, na.rm = TRUE))\n  cat(\"\\nHere are the first few elements:\\n\", head(x), \"\\n\")\n}\n\nNow, when you print an object of class specialvector, the custom print() command is invoked:\n\nx\n\nThis is a special vector of length 10 \nIts mean value is 5.5 and its median is 5.5\nHere are the first few elements:\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 \n\n\nIf needed, you can call the default or another appropriate method directly:\n\nprint.default(x)\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"specialvector\" \"numeric\"      \n\n\nYou can change the vector back to a regular numeric vector, or a different class, just as easily:\n\nclass(x) <- \"numeric\"\nx\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10"

The twoAdvantages of data.table include:\n\nSuper fast reading, writing, and handling of big datasets\n\nfast read & write of delimited files with fread() and fwrite()\nin-place operations without creating unnecessary copies of data\n\nCompact and flexible syntax for data manipulation great for handling small or big data\n\nIn health data science, it is common to handle very large datasets, especially when working with electronic health record (EHR) data. In such cases, we often have to read, clean, reshape, transform, and merge multiple tables of different dimensions, often featuring many millions of rows and thousands of columns. The benefits of data.table become immediately apparent in such scenarios."

This means that if a method does not exist for data.table, the method for data.frame will be used - review classes and generic functions.\nAs part of improving efficieny, data.tables do away with row names. Instead of using rownames, you can and should add an extra column (e.g. “ID”) with the same information - this is advisable when working with data.frames as well.\nA rather convenient option is to have data.tables print each column’s class below the column name. You can pass the argument class = TRUE to print() or set the global option datatable.print.class using options()\n\noptions(datatable.print.class = TRUE)\ndt\n\n       A     B      C\n   <int> <num> <char>\n1:     1   1.2      a\n2:     2   4.3      b\n3:     3   9.7      b\n4:     4   5.6      a\n5:     5   8.1      a\n\n\nSame as with a data.frame, to automatically convert string to factors, you can use the stringsAsFactors argument (or factor() directly):\n\ndt <- data.table(A = 1:5,\n                 B = c(1.2, 4.3, 9.7, 5.6, 8.1),\n                 C = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"a\", \"a\"),\n                 stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\ndt\n\n       A     B      C\n   <int> <num> <fctr>\n1:     1   1.2      a\n2:     2   4.3      b\n3:     3   9.7      b\n4:     4   5.6      a\n5:     5   8.1      a\n\n\n\n29.3.2 By coercion: as.data.table()\n\n\ndat <- data.frame(A = 1:5,\n                  B = c(1.2, 4.3, 9.7, 5.6, 8.1),\n                  C = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"a\", \"a\"),\n                  stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\ndat\n\n  A   B C\n1 1 1.2 a\n2 2 4.3 b\n3 3 9.7 b\n4 4 5.6 a\n5 5 8.1 a\n\ndat2 <- as.data.table(dat)\ndat2\n\n       A     B      C\n   <int> <num> <fctr>\n1:     1   1.2      a\n2:     2   4.3      b\n3:     3   9.7      b\n4:     4   5.6      a\n5:     5   8.1      a\n\n\n\n29.3.3 By coercion in-place: setDT()\n\nsetDT converts a list or data.frame into a data.table in-place.

It is orders of magnitude faster for very large data (e.g. thousands to millions of rows) and it can read directly from URLs and zipped files. The sep argument defines the separator (same as in read.csv() and read.table()), but when set to \"auto\" (the default) it does a great job of figuring it out by itself.\n\ndat <- fread(\"path/to/input.csv\")\ndat <- fread(\"https::/url/to/input.csv.gz\")\n\nFor its speed and convenience, fread() is recommended over read.csv()/read.table() even if you intend to work with a data.frame exclusively, in which case you can pass the argument data.table = FALSE.\n\n29.3.5 Write a data.table to a CSV: fwrite()\n\nSimilar to fread(), fwrite() can be a lot faster than write.csv()\n\nfwrite(dt, \"/path/to/text.csv\")\n\n\n29.3.6 Save data.table to an RDS:\nSame as any R object, you can save a data.table to disk using saveRDS(). Suppose you have read data in with fread() or coerced a dataset using as.data.table(), done some cleaning up, type conversions, data transformations, etc, this is the preferred way to save your work, so you can reload at any time.\n\nsaveRDS(dt, \"/path/to/data.rds\")"

    "text": "29.6 Filter rows\nThere are many similarities and some notable differences in how indexing works in a data.table vs. a data.frame.\nFiltering rows with an integer or logical index is largely the same in a data.frame and a data.table, but in a data.table you can omit the comma to select all columns:\n\ndf[c(1, 3, 5), ]\n\n  A   B C\n1 1 1.2 a\n3 3 9.7 b\n5 5 8.1 a\n\ndt[c(1, 3, 5), ]\n\n       A     B      C\n   <int> <num> <fctr>\n1:     1   1.2      a\n2:     3   9.7      b\n3:     5   8.1      a\n\ndt[c(1, 3, 5)]\n\n       A     B      C\n   <int> <num> <fctr>\n1:     1   1.2      a\n2:     3   9.7      b\n3:     5   8.1      a\n\n\nUsing a variable that holds a row index, whether integer or logical:\n\nrowid <- c(1, 3, 5)\ndf[rowid, ]\n\n  A   B C\n1 1 1.2 a\n3 3 9.7 b\n5 5 8.1 a\n\ndt[rowid, ]\n\n       A     B      C\n   <int> <num> <fctr>\n1:     1   1.2      a\n2:     3   9.7      b\n3:     5   8.1      a\n\ndt[rowid]\n\n       A     B      C\n   <int> <num> <fctr>\n1:     1   1.2      a\n2:     3   9.7      b\n3:     5   8.1      a\n\n\n\nrowbn <- c(T, F, T, F, T)\ndf[rowbn, ]\n\n  A   B C\n1 1 1.2 a\n3 3 9.7 b\n5 5 8.1 a\n\ndt[rowbn, ]\n\n       A     B      C\n   <int> <num> <fctr>\n1:     1   1.2      a\n2:     3   9.7      b\n3:     5   8.1      a\n\ndt[rowbn]\n\n       A     B      C\n   <int> <num> <fctr>\n1:     1   1.2      a\n2:     3   9.7      b\n3:     5   8.1      a\n\n\n\n29.6.1 Conditional filtering\nAs a reminder, there are a few ways to conditionally filter cases in a data.frame:\n\ndf[df$A > mean(df$A) & df$B > mean(df$B), ]\n\n  A   B C\n5 5 8.1 a\n\nsubset(df, A > mean(A) & B > mean(B))\n\n  A   B C\n5 5 8.1 a\n\nwith(df, df[A > mean(A) & B > mean(B), ])\n\n  A   B C\n5 5 8.1 a\n\n\ndata.table allows you to refer to column names directly and unquoted, which makes writing filter conditions easier/more compact:\n\ndt[A > mean(A) & B > mean(B)]\n\n       A     B      C\n   <int> <num> <fctr>\n1:     5   8.1      a\n\n\nThe data.table package also includes an S3 method for subset() that works the same way as with a data.frame:\n\nsubset(dt, A > mean(A) & B > mean(B))\n\n       A     B      C\n   <int> <num> <fctr>\n1:     5   8.1      a\n\n\nAs another example, exclude cases base on missingness in a specific column:\n\nadf <- as.data.frame(sapply(1:5, function(i) rnorm(10)))\nadf |> head()\n\n          V1          V2         V3         V4          V5\n1  0.3769512 -1.59184446  0.1305914  1.9299704  0.32282735\n2  0.3465714 -1.06619941 -0.2566953  1.9892981  1.16673698\n3 -0.1095721 -0.66131040  1.2793561 -0.7037818 -0.08101752\n4 -0.5518752 -0.00699602  0.2746761 -1.0178542  2.66905600\n5 -1.0178125  1.31270203  0.4414643  1.0870632 -1.33171994\n6 -0.2894443 -0.42246668  0.9465981 -0.5684382 -0.16147146\n\nadf[1, 3] <- adf[3, 4] <- adf[5, 3] <- adf[7, 3] <- NA\nadt <- as.data.table(adf)\n\n\nadf[!is.na(adf$V3), ]\n\n            V1          V2         V3         V4          V5\n2   0.34657136 -1.06619941 -0.2566953  1.9892981  1.16673698\n3  -0.10957215 -0.66131040  1.2793561         NA -0.08101752\n4  -0.55187523 -0.00699602  0.2746761 -1.0178542  2.66905600\n6  -0.28944433 -0.42246668  0.9465981 -0.5684382 -0.16147146\n8   0.07702379  0.40965085 -0.4066543  1.2215327  0.32089564\n9   1.15636091  0.63626170  2.5486899  0.1320393  0.65122976\n10 -0.45791229 -0.08391576  0.4160697  0.4208003 -0.67763781\n\nadt[!is.na(V3)]\n\n            V1          V2         V3         V4          V5\n         <num>       <num>      <num>      <num>       <num>\n1:  0.34657136 -1.06619941 -0.2566953  1.9892981  1.16673698\n2: -0.10957215 -0.66131040  1.2793561         NA -0.08101752\n3: -0.55187523 -0.00699602  0.2746761 -1.0178542  2.66905600\n4: -0.28944433 -0.42246668  0.9465981 -0.5684382 -0.16147146\n5:  0.07702379  0.40965085 -0.4066543  1.2215327  0.32089564\n6:  1.15636091  0.63626170  2.5486899  0.1320393  0.65122976\n7: -0.45791229 -0.08391576  0.4160697  0.4208003 -0.67763781"

You have direct access to the variables within it. If you want to refer to variables outside the data.table, you prefix the variable name with .. similar to how you access the directory above your current working directory in the system shell:\nAlternatively, you can use the .SD special symbol together with the .SDcols argument:\n\ndt[, .SD, .SDcols = colid]\n\n       A     B\n   <int> <num>\n1:     1   1.2\n2:     2   4.3\n3:     3   9.7\n4:     4   5.6\n5:     5   8.1\n\n\nThink of .SD as a sub-data.table with columns defined by .SDcols (if SDcols is not defined, .SD refers to the entire data.table).\nThe two dots tell the data.table to not look for the variable within the data.table columns, but in the enclosing environment.\nSelecting a single column by name returns a vector:\n\ndt[, A]\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nSelecting one or more columns by name enclosed in list() or .() (which, in this case, is short for list()), always returns a data.table:\n\ndt[, .(A)]\n\n       A\n   <int>\n1:     1\n2:     2\n3:     3\n4:     4\n5:     5\n\ndt[, .(A, B)]\n\n       A     B\n   <int> <num>\n1:     1   1.2\n2:     2   4.3\n3:     3   9.7\n4:     4   5.6\n5:     5   8.1"

Some of the welcome recent changes aim to reduce the total number of functions exported by the package.\nCore operations include:\ndplyr operates on data.frames as well as the tidyverse’s data.frame replacement, known by the bizarre name of tibble. Here, we convert iris to a tibble as an easy way to limit the number of rows printed by default in the output (without changing other Rmarkdown options, custom hooks, etc.) and as an introduction to tiblles.\nNote that dplyr masks a number of builtin functions when loaded."

    "text": "This chapter is an introduction to what is known as base graphics, which is provided by the built-in graphics package. This includes a large number of functions to create plots, add graphical elements to existing plots, and control plotting parameters. Default argument values or base graphics functions produce minimalist-looking plots, but they can be customized extensively. In this chapter we shall begin with these simple plots and demonstrate some of the more common/useful ways to customize them. The extensive documentation of base graphics functions details all the ways the can be further customized.  Some of the most common and important types of plots can be built with the following functions:\nR documentation for each of the above commands provides extensive coverage of graphical parameters. ?par gives the main documentation file for a long list of graphical parameters. These can be set with the par() command before using any plotting command. Most can also be passed to individual plotting commands. par() documentation specifies which parameters can only be set with a call to par()."

They produce a box that resembles the corresponding symbol. “none” draws no box but allows the axes to show:\n\nplot(x, y, bty = \"l\")\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(x, y, bty = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n38.5.4 pch\n\nThe default point character is a circle as seen above. This helps visualize overlapping points (especially for devices that do not support transparency).\nThere are 25 point characters, designated by integers 1 through 25.\nHere’s a preview of all 25 pch options. pch types 21 through 25 can be filled by a color specified by bg.\n\nplot(1:25, rep(1, 25), pch = 1:25, bg = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\nLet’s use a solid disc:\n\nplot(x, y, bty = \"n\", pch = 16)\n\n\n\n\nWe cannot tell how many points are overlapping in the middle and therefore it’s a good idea to make the points a little transparent.\nThere are different ways to add transparency (see Colors). The easiest way is probably to use adjustcolor(). In the context of colors, alpha refers to transparency: a = 1 is opaque and a = 0 is completely transparent (therefore use a value greater than 0).\n\nplot(x, y,\n     bty = \"n\", pch = 16,\n     col = adjustcolor(\"skyblue\", alpha.f = .5))\n\n\n\n\n\n38.5.5 grid\nWe can add a grid behind the plot area using the panel.first argument, which accepts a graphical expression (a function that draws something), which will be evaluated before plotting the points on the graph (therefore appears behind the points).\n\nplot(x, y,\n     bty = \"n\", pch = 16,\n     col = adjustcolor(\"skyblue\", alpha.f = .5),\n     panel.first = grid(lty = 1, col = 'gray90'))\n\n\n\n\n\n38.5.6 main, xlab, ylab\n\n\nplot(x, y,\n     bty = \"n\", pch = 16,\n     col = adjustcolor(\"skyblue\", alpha.f = .5),\n     panel.first = grid(lty = 1, col = 'gray90'),\n     main = \"y vs. x\",\n     xlab = \"Variable x (xunits)\",\n     ylab = \"Variable y (yunits)\")\n\n\n\n\nNote that depending on where you intend to display the plot, you may leave the title blank and instead place it in the figure caption along with an explanation of the data (e.g. in a journal article)."

Note how R automatically gets the corresponding dimension names. For this example we use the builtin VADeaths dataset, which is a matrix.\n\nbarplot(VADeaths[, 1])\n\n\n\n\n\nbarplot(VADeaths[1, ])\n\n\n\n\n\n38.4.1.1 col and border: bar fill and border color\nAs in most plotting functions, color is controlled by the col argument. border can be set to any color separately, or to NA to omit, which gives a clean look:\n\nbarplot(VADeaths[, 1],\n        col = \"aquamarine3\", border = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n38.4.2 Matrix\nWe can draw barplots of multiple columns at the same time by passing a matrix input. The grouping on the x-axis is based on the columns. By default, data from different rows is stacked. The argument legend.text can be used to add a legend with the row labels:\n\nbarplot(VADeaths, legend.text = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can draw groups of bars beside each other with the argument beside = TRUE:\n\nbarplot(VADeaths, beside = TRUE,\n        legend.text = TRUE, args.legend = list(x = \"topright\"))\n\n\n\n\nTo use custom colors, we pass a vector of length equal to the number of bars within each group. These will get recycled across groups, giving a consistent color coding.\nHere, we use the adjustcolor() function again to produce 5 shades of navy.\n\ncol <- sapply(seq(.2, .8, length.out = 5), function(i) adjustcolor(\"navy\", i))\nbarplot(VADeaths,\n        col = col,\n        border = NA,\n        beside = TRUE,\n        legend.text = TRUE, args.legend = list(x = \"topright\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n38.4.3 Formula\nThe formula notation allows you to specify one or more continuous variables on the LHS and one or more categorical on the RHS.

For par() to have an effect, it must be called prior to the plotting function whose output you wish to customize.  Some graphical parameters can only be set with a call to par(). However, many parameters can also be passed using the ... construct of each base plotting function. Some common base graphical parameters:\n\n\npch: Point character\n\ncol: Color\n\ncex: Character expansion, i.e. relative size\n\nbty: Box type\n\nxlab: x-axis label\n\nylab: y-axis label\n\nmain: Main title\n\nmar: Plot margins\n\nYou can see what the current value of these parameters is by calling par() or directly accessing a specific parameter:\n\npar()$mar\n\n[1] 5.1 4.1 4.1 2.1\n\n\nmar sets the plot margins. It is a vector of length 4 and each number corresponds to the bottom-left-top-right margin, in that order. Use it to reduce empty white space between plots or add space if labels are getting cropped, for example.  Always make sure that your plotting characters, axis labels and titles are legible.\n\n\ncex: Character expansion for the plotting characters\n\ncex.axis: cex for axis annotation\n\ncex.lab: cex for x and y labels\n\ncex.main: cex for main title\n\nNote: All of these can be set either with a call to par() prior to plotting or passed as arguments in a plotting command, like plot().  There is one important distinction: cex set with par() (which defaults to 1), sets the baseline and all other cex parameters multiply it. However, cex set within plot() still multiplies cex set with par(), but only affects the plotting character size.\n\n38.8.1 Save and reload graphical parameters\nYou can save all current graphical parameters by assigning the output of par() to an object.\n\npar_default <- par()\n\nThere are a few parameters that you cannot control, those are read-only. You can exclude those since you cannot change them anyway:\n\npar_default <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)\n\nIf you make changes to par() to produce plots and you want to recover the parameters you saved above, you can reload them by passing them to par():\n\npar(par_default)\n\nAlternatively, you can always restart the graphics device using dev.off() and then making a new plot.

The two core uses of resampling in predictive modeling / machinbe learning are model selection (a.k.a. tuning) and model assessment. By convention, we use the terms training and validation set when refering to model selection, and training and testing set when refering to model assessment. The terminology is unfortunately not intuitive and has led to much confusion.

This is crucial for non-normally distributed continuous outcomes or imbalanced datasets. 10 is a common value for k, called 10-fold.

You want to suggest a new feature is added to the code:\n\nCreate a new branch, e.g. mynewfeature\n\nWork in new branch until you are ready happy to share and testing is complete\nGo on to the repository website, select your branch and perform a “Pull request” asking that the changes in your mynewfeature branch are merged into master\n\nThe repository owner/s will review the request and can merge"

It covers basic commands to allow you to read in data, perform common manipulations, plot data and run common tests. R is a programming language developed specifically for statistical computing and graphics.  It is often mis-characterized as a “statistical package”, similar to SPSS, for example, but as a full programming language it has far more extensive functionality.  For a more thorough coverage of the topic, see the main part of this book.  Links to book chapters will be provided throughout these notes for those interested in reading up further into particular topics.  R can be used to perform most, if not all, operations in statistics, data science, machine learning. This is not a crash course in statistics, data science, or machine learning, but an introduction to the language itself.  If you have any questions, write them down and make sure to ask them during each section’s Q&A."

    "text": "Introduction to Programming\nEveryone can code  Everyone can learn how to program. Whether it takes you a minute or a little longer to learn how to write the code neessary to perform a certain, you can master it. Do not worry about comparing yourself to others.  As with more or less everything, a) motivation is key and b) you get good with practice.  You are here because, presumably, you have important questions to answet using data.  Knowing even a little code can give you the power to work with your own data without depending fully on someone else. At the same time, it makes collaborating with other scientistics, clinicians, statisticians, etc. much more effective & efficient.  You don’t learn to code by reading books or slides, you learn to code by doing. Ideally, work on data you are interested in, trying to asnwet questions you care about.  Learning to code can be exciting and frustrating. It’s similar to learning to play an instrument - like the guitar. At first, it may seem unnatural and annoying, but you can get better at it rather quickly and it’s very rewarding and satisfying.  It is important to be able to read & write code. Coding requires logic & creativity  Programming is based on logic and learning to code helps structure your thoughts, your experiments, your reasoning.  Programming languages are human constructs. They developed to answer important needs. They develop with time, as needs evolve. Many design choices are explained historically, a few may be more arbitrary. Everything is a series of simple, manageable steps  Remember this: the shortest and simplest piece of code up to the longest and most complex is made of a sequence of relatively simple steps.  Always be clear about what you want to achieve first, then break it down step-by-step in code. Each step is relatively easy to figure out and check that it is working as desired. A common mistake is to write multiple steps in one go, and then have a hard time figuring out where an error occurs or why.  To get from A to B using code there are virtually always multiple different paths. That can be confusing or perhaps frustrating, but it is also exciting. Programming to the uninitiated may seem a a rigid exercise but it is highly creative. Remember that there objective and subjective differences to consider when designing a code to take you from A to B. Suppose you have two approaches that have the same input and produce the same output. An objective difference would be how fast each completes the task and how many lines of code or number of function calls it requires. A subjective difference would be the programming style / syntax used / whether the code is “elegant” - a pretty broad topic. Errors happen and they are not all the same  Errors in code happen all the time, it is part of the process. But, not all errors are the same, far from it. One crucial difference is coding errors that:  - stop execution of code and produce an error message. This is the best case scenario because it can’t go unnoticed. - do not stop execution of code but produce a warning. These warnings are too often ignored. They may be serios or trivial, but must be investigated. - do not stop execution and produce no warnings. This is the worst kind of error since it is silent. These are very common and the only way to recognize them are to check the output. Details matter (a lot)  A lot of beginner and non-beginner mistakes occur because a variable or function name is misspelled.  ALWAYS READ ERROR AND WARNING MESSAGES.\nThe all-caps is because this is a) essential and b) far too often ignored. Always check yourself  Remember: the most important thing is to ensure you produce correct results at each step. Don’t place writing smart or elegant code above writing correct code. Spend time reviewing your code. Ideally, if possible, have one or more other people review your code. Document everything  Make a habit from the very beginning to always use comments in your code to explai what you are trying to achieve and why. You will often need to revisit your code after some time has passed. Life will be very hard if it’s not clear what is happening and why.  Programming is largely a team sport. A lot of code is written collaboratively or is used by people other than the author. Again, comprehensive documentation is super important. Help is at your fingertips  Whether you are just starting out or you are a seasoned programmer, you have many sources of information to help you troubleshoot or learn new skills.  - Use the built-in documentation! Builtin help files, written by the code author, are almost always the best place to start. Their quality will vary, but they are often sufficient to learn how to use a function properly. - Programming is largely an online activity. All documentation and source code (for open source projects) is available online. Most errors or difficulties you encounter have been encountered many times before by others. A very large number of Q&A sites, blogs, forums are a web search away. Copy-pasting an error message into a search engine will often result in multiple hits."

    "section": "\n6.1 Base types",
    "text": "6.1 Base types\nThe simplest and most fundamental object in R is the vector: a one-dimensional collection of elements of the same data type, e.g. numbers, characters, etc. (known as an “atomic” vector).  For example, a numeric vector may consist of elements 12, 14, 20, and a character vector may consist of elements \"x\", \"y\", \"z\".  Vectors can exist as stand-alone objects, or they can exist within other data structures, e.g. data.frames, lists, etc.  This chapter covers different atomic vectors, and the next covers data structures (Chapter 7).  R includes a number of builtin data types. These are defined by the R core team - users cannot define their own data types.  Users can, however, define their own classes (Chapter 24).  The main/most common data types in R are:\n\n\nNumeric, including integer and double\n\nCharacter\n\nLogical (i.e. TRUE or FALSE, a.k.a. Boolean)\n\nOther data types include environments and closures i.e. functions (Chapter 15)."
