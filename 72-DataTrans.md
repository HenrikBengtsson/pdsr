## Continuous variables

### Standardization / Scaling & Centering with `scale()`

Depending on your modeling needs / algorithms you plan to use, it is often important to scale and/or center your data. Note that many functions, but not all, will automatically scale and center data internally if it is required by the algorithm. Check the function documentation.  
If you manually scale and/or center your data, you must:  

* Perform scaling and centering on your training data
* Save the centering and scaling parameters for each feature
* Apply the training set-dervied centering and scaling parameters to the test set prior to prediction/inference

A common mistake is to either scale training and testing data together in the beginning, or scale them separately.  

Standardizing, i.e. converting to Z-scores, involving subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. 
Scaling and centering in R is performed with the `scale` function. By default, both arguments `scale` and `center` are TRUE:


```r
iris.scaled <- scale(iris[, -5])
```

First, let's check that it did what we were hoping:  


```r
colMeans(iris.scaled)
```

```
 Sepal.Length   Sepal.Width  Petal.Length   Petal.Width 
-4.480675e-16  2.035409e-16 -2.844947e-17 -3.714621e-17 
```


```r
apply(iris.scaled, 2, sd)
```

```
Sepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width 
           1            1            1            1 
```

Good - We got mean of 0 (effectively) and standard deviation of 1 for each column.  

Now, let's get the scale and center attributes:


```r
attributes(iris.scaled)
```

```
$dim
[1] 150   4

$dimnames
$dimnames[[1]]
NULL

$dimnames[[2]]
[1] "Sepal.Length" "Sepal.Width"  "Petal.Length" "Petal.Width" 


$`scaled:center`
Sepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width 
    5.843333     3.057333     3.758000     1.199333 

$`scaled:scale`
Sepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width 
   0.8280661    0.4358663    1.7652982    0.7622377 
```

Let's save the scale and center attributes and then check some values so that we are clear what is happening:


```r
(.center <- attr(iris.scaled, "scaled:center"))
```

```
Sepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width 
    5.843333     3.057333     3.758000     1.199333 
```

```r
(.scale <- attr(iris.scaled, "scaled:scale"))
```

```
Sepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width 
   0.8280661    0.4358663    1.7652982    0.7622377 
```

```r
Sepal.Length_scaled <- (iris$Sepal.Length - .center[1]) / .scale[1]
all(Sepal.Length_scaled == iris.scaled[, "Sepal.Length"])
```

```
[1] TRUE
```

Note: Due to limitation in numerical precision, checking sets of floats for equality after multiple operations is not recommended. Always a good idea to plot:


```r
mplot3.fit(Sepal.Length_scaled, iris.scaled[, "Sepal.Length"])
```

### Log-transform with `log()`



For the following example, `x` is an unknown feature in a new dataset we were just given.  
We start by plotting its distribution:


```r
mplot3.x(x)
```

<img src="72-DataTrans_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="960" />

We can see it is highly skewed. A log transform may help here.  
Let's check:


```r
mplot3.x(log(x))
```

<img src="72-DataTrans_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="960" />

Looks like a good deal.

### Data binning with `cut()`

Another approach for the above variable might be to bin it.  
Let's look at a few different ways to bin continuous data.


#### Equal-interval cuts

By passing an integer to `cut()`'s `breaks` argument, we get that many equally-spaced intervals:


```r
x_cut4 <- cut(x, breaks = 4)
table(x_cut4)
```

```
x_cut4
(0.248,189]   (189,377]   (377,565]   (565,754] 
        981          17           1           1 
```

Because the data is so skewed, equal intervals are not helpful in this case. The majority of the data gets grouped into a single bin.  
Let's visualize the cuts.


```r
(xcuts5 <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = 5))
```

```
[1]   1.0000 189.0175 377.0350 565.0525 753.0700
```

```r
mplot3.x(x, par.reset = FALSE)
abline(v = xcuts5, col = "red", lwd = 1.5)
```

<img src="72-DataTrans_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="960" />

Note: We used `par.reset = FALSE` to stop `mplot3.x` from resetting its custom `par()` settings so that we can continue adding elements to the same plot, in this case with the `abline` command.  

#### Quantile cuts

Instead, we can get quantiles. We ask for 5 quantiles which corresponds to 4 intervals:


```r
(xquants5 <- quantile(x, seq(0, 1, length.out = 5)))
```

```
       0%       25%       50%       75%      100% 
  1.00000  10.65099  20.04102  39.21473 753.06995 
```

```r
mplot3.x(x, par.reset = F)
abline(v = xquants5, col = "green", lwd = 1.5)
```

<img src="72-DataTrans_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="960" />

We can use the quantiles as breaks in `cut()`:


```r
x_cutq4 <- cut(x, breaks = xquants5)
table(x_cutq4)
```

```
x_cutq4
  (1,10.7]  (10.7,20]  (20,39.2] (39.2,753] 
       249        250        250        250 
```

With quantile cuts, each bin contains the same number of observations (+/- 1).  



We just got a new mystery `x`! Let's plot it:

```r
mplot3.x(x)
```

<img src="72-DataTrans_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="960" />

It may be worth binning into 2. Let's look at equal-interval and quantile cuts:  


```r
(xcuts3 <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = 3))
```

```
[1]  6.53193 25.73907 44.94622
```

```r
(xquants3 <- quantile(x, seq(0, 1, length.out = 3)))
```

```
      0%      50%     100% 
 6.53193 10.59441 44.94622 
```


```r
mplot3.x(x, par.reset = F)
abline(v = xcuts3, col = "red", lwd = 1.5)
```

<img src="72-DataTrans_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="960" />

```r
mplot3.x(x, par.reset = F)
abline(v = xquants3, col = "green", lwd = 1.5)
```

<img src="72-DataTrans_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-2.png" width="960" />


```r
dplot3.x(x)
```

## Categorical variables

Many algorithms, or their implementations, do not support categorical variables directly and to use them, you must convert all categorical variables to some type of numeric encoding.

### Integer encoding

If the categorical data is ordinal, you simply convert them to integers.  
For example, the following ordered factor:


```r
(brightness <- factor(c("bright", "brightest", "darkest",
                    "bright", "dark", "dim", "dark"),
                  levels = c("darkest", "dark", "dim", "bright", "brightest"),
                  ordered = TRUE))
```

```
[1] bright    brightest darkest   bright    dark      dim       dark     
Levels: darkest < dark < dim < bright < brightest
```

...can be directly coerced to integer:


```r
as.integer(brightness)
```

```
[1] 4 5 1 4 2 3 2
```

### One-hot encoding

When categorical features are **not** ordinal, and your algorithm cannot handle them directly, you can one-hot encode them. (This is similar to creating dummy variables in statistics). In one-hot encoding, each categorical feature is converted to k binary features, where k = number of unique values in the input, such that only one feature is 1 per case.


```r
admission_reasons <- c("plannedSurgery", "emergencySurgery", "medical")
(admission <- sample(admission_reasons, 10, T))
```

```
 [1] "plannedSurgery"   "medical"          "plannedSurgery"   "medical"         
 [5] "medical"          "emergencySurgery" "emergencySurgery" "emergencySurgery"
 [9] "emergencySurgery" "emergencySurgery"
```

We can use the **rtemis** `oneHot()` function:


```r
(admission_oneHot <- oneHot(admission))
```

```
      admission.emergencySurgery admission.medical admission.plannedSurgery
 [1,]                          0                 0                        1
 [2,]                          0                 1                        0
 [3,]                          0                 0                        1
 [4,]                          0                 1                        0
 [5,]                          0                 1                        0
 [6,]                          1                 0                        0
 [7,]                          1                 0                        0
 [8,]                          1                 0                        0
 [9,]                          1                 0                        0
[10,]                          1                 0                        0
```
