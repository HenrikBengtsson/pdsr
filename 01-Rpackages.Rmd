## R
This book was compiled using `r R.Version()$version.string`.  
Make sure you have the latest version by visiting the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org)

## R packages
### CRAN
The Comprehensive R Archive Network is the official R package repository and currently hosts 15338 packages. To install a package from CRAN, use the builtin `install.packages` command:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('glmnet')
```

#### Check for outdated packages
```{r eval = FALSE}
old.packages()
```

#### Update installed packages
If you don't set `ask = FALSE`, you will have to accept each package update separately.
```{r eval = FALSE}
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```

### GitHub
GitHub contains a large number of R packages, some of which also exist in CRAN, but the GitHub version may be updated a lot more frequently. To install from GitHub, you need to have the `remotes` package from CRAN first:
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("username/reponame")
```

Note: Running `remotes::install_github("user/repo")` will not reinstall a previously installed package, unless it has been updated.

### Bioconductor
Bioconductor is a repository which includes tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data, among others. To install package from Bioconductor, first install the `BiocManager` package from CRAN:
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages(â€œBiocManager")
```
and then use that similar to the builtin `install.packages`:
```{r eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("packageName")
```

### Installed packages
List all R packages installed on your system with `installed.packages()` (the following block has not been run to prevent a very long output)
```{r eval = FALSE}
installed.packages()
```

List attached packages with `search()`:
```{r}
search()
```

List attached packages with their system path:
```{r}
searchpaths()
```
